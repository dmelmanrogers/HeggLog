# Laziness and STG Plan

## Why Laziness Is Required

A Haskell 2010 compiler must implement non-strict semantics. Strict compilation
is not Haskell semantics.

Required examples:

```haskell
const 1 (1 `div` 0)
```

evaluates to `1`.

```haskell
let x = 1 `div` 0 in 5
```

evaluates to `5`.

```haskell
case (1 `div` 0) of ...
```

raises a runtime error because `case` demands the scrutinee.

The current `.hg` runtime is strict and therefore is not sufficient for Haskell
2010. It remains the regression baseline for the current compiler-supported
subset.

## Runtime Objects

The Haskell 2010 runtime needs object representations for:

- closure header
- function closure
- thunk closure
- constructor closure
- indirection/update closure
- black-hole marker
- primitive values
- boxed and unboxed value decisions

The object header should carry enough tag or info-table data for enter,
update, case dispatch, and diagnostics. The first implementation can choose a
simple uniform representation before optimizing layout.

## Evaluation

Required evaluation operations:

- enter closure
- force thunk
- update thunk
- represent case as demand
- force primitive operands
- treat constructors as values
- preserve sharing after thunk evaluation
- support recursive heap bindings for `letrec`

Function arguments are lazy unless forced. Primitive operations force their
operands. Case forces the scrutinee enough to choose an alternative. Let binds
thunks rather than evaluating right-hand sides eagerly.

## STG-like IR

The STG-like IR should model:

- functions
- thunks
- constructors
- `let` and `letrec`
- case expressions
- alternatives
- primitive operations
- update flags

Validation must check unique binders, resolved variables, arity, constructor
tags, alternative coverage where applicable, and type/representation
consistency.

Current implementation status: `Haskell2010.STG.Syntax`,
`Haskell2010.STG.Validate`, and `Haskell2010.STG.Eval` implement the in-process
STG runtime MVP. The evaluator models heap closures, updateable and
single-entry thunks, sharing after update, black-hole detection, case demand,
Bool, user-constructor, list, tuple, and Prelude-data dispatch, constructor
fields, recursive heap bindings, and checked primitive errors.
`Haskell2010.STG.Lower` now lowers validating Core modules into
validating STG while erasing type abstraction/application and preserving lazy
semantics against the STG evaluator. Native runtime object layout, LLVM
lowering, and runtime linking are implemented for the current executable subset,
including custom ADTs, nested constructor patterns, lists, tuples, built-in
Prelude data constructors, generated Core Prelude list/Bool functions, and
recursive top-level/local functions. User-defined type class dictionaries lower
as ordinary constructor closures with selector/method calls in the initial
dictionary slice. The first IO action layer is implemented for `main :: IO ()`,
`putStrLn`, `getLine`, `print`, `return`, `(>>)`, `(>>=)`, expression and
bind-statement `do` sequencing, native source strings and built-in `show`
results as list-of-`Char` output, built-in scalar/string/list `Show`, and
line-oriented stdin reads into ordinary `[Char]` values. Handles, rich IO
errors, and broader IO remain future expansions.
RTS-009 chooses process-lifetime
allocation for this executable subset: generated STG LLVM routes heap-object,
environment, constructor-field-array, and runtime string-buffer allocations
through `haskell_compiler_hs_alloc_process_lifetime`, which aborts on allocation failure
and does not free or collect objects before process exit. RTS-019 documents the
corresponding leak/ownership contract: this retention is intentional for the
current executable subset, all native heap allocation must stay behind the
allocation helper boundary, and long-running allocation-heavy workloads remain
outside the supported runtime claim until an arena or GC task replaces the
helper implementation.

## LLVM Lowering

The lazy backend lowers STG-like IR to LLVM by using:

- closure layout
- runtime calls
- enter/apply convention
- case dispatch
- constructor tags
- heap allocation
- process-lifetime allocation helper
- runtime linking

Generated LLVM for Haskell 2010 source now includes a boxed lazy STG runtime for
the current executable subset. The current strict `.hg` LLVM backend remains
separate and does not by itself implement lazy Haskell semantics, even though it
provides the shared LLVM and clang toolchain path.

## Testing

Required tests:

- laziness
- sharing
- recursive thunk/black-hole behavior
- terminating top-level/local/mutual/list recursion
- constructor case dispatch
- checked arithmetic and division runtime errors
- native wet tests

Representative wet tests must compile `.hs` sources to native executables and
run the artifacts directly, comparing optimized and `--no-egglog` behavior
where applicable.
