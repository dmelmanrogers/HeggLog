# HeggLog Roadmap: Haskell 2010 Native Compiler

## Project Goal

HeggLog is a Haskell 2010 native-code compiler project implemented in Haskell.
The compiler's active target is Haskell 2010 source code compiled to real
native machine-code executables through LLVM and clang.

The current `.hg` compiler is the backend and middle-end substrate, the
regression baseline, and the existing proof that native executable output,
Egglog optimization, closure conversion infrastructure, LLVM lowering, and
end-to-end wet testing work. It is not the final source language endpoint. The
Haskell 2010 path now compiles the documented executable subset, while the
full Haskell 2010 surface remains roadmap work. Progress toward full
conformance is now measured by a mandatory manifest-backed Haskell 2010
conformance suite; passing representative executable-subset cases do not imply
complete Haskell 2010 support.

## Target Pipeline

```text
Haskell 2010 source
  -> layout-aware lexer/parser
  -> renamer
  -> typechecker
  -> desugarer
  -> typed Core
  -> Egglog Core optimizer
  -> STG-like lazy IR
  -> runtime system
  -> LLVM IR
  -> clang / LLVM toolchain
  -> native machine-code executable
```

## Output Criterion

The primary success criterion is:

```bash
hegglog compile Main.hs -o main
./main
```

The executable must behave according to the implemented Haskell 2010 semantics.

## Engineering Backlog

The detailed task backlog is maintained in
[haskell2010-todo.md](haskell2010-todo.md). The roadmap defines milestones; the
to-do document defines executable engineering tasks with stable IDs,
dependencies, acceptance criteria, tests, documentation requirements, a
machine-readable JSON mirror, and validation through
`scripts/validate-haskell2010-todo.py`.

## Completed Compiler Substrate

Implemented and tested today for the current `.hg` compiler-supported subset:

- strict `.hg` source frontend
- parser, typechecker, and interpreter
- ANF and resolved ANF
- Egglog backend for supported ANF fragments
- checked signed `Int64` semantics
- lambda lifting and closure conversion for currently supported local functions
- Backend IR
- LLVM IR generation
- native executable output through `clang`
- mandatory end-to-end wet testing of native executable artifacts
- CI build/test/package checks and wet-test execution

These are carry-forward compiler assets. They are not Haskell 2010 frontend
capabilities until a Haskell 2010 parser, renamer, typechecker, desugarer, lazy
runtime, and conformance tests exist.

Deliverables:

- typed Core syntax, Core types, Core validator, Core pretty-printer
- free-variable and substitution utilities
- constructs: `Var`, `Lit`, `Lam`, `App`, `Let`, `LetRec`, `Case`,
  `Constructor`, `PrimOp`, and type annotations/metadata

Acceptance criteria:

- generated Core validates
- all binders are unique
- all variables are resolved
- primitive operations are typed
- constructors are arity-checked
- case alternatives are type-consistent

### Phase 5 - Haskell Typechecker, Core-0

- explicit type signatures
- Core generation
- Core-0: `Int`, `Bool`, functions, top-level definitions, lambdas,

Acceptance criteria:

- `id :: a -> a` typechecks
- `const :: a -> b -> a` typechecks
- polymorphic let works
- ill-typed programs fail with spans
- generated Core validates

### Phase 6 - Lazy Semantics and STG-like IR

Deliverables:

- STG-like IR for functions, thunks, constructors, case expressions,
  `let`/`letrec`, updateable thunks, and primitive operations
- semantics where function arguments are lazy unless forced, case forces its
  scrutinee, let binds thunks, letrec supports recursive heap bindings,
  constructors are values, and primitive operations force operands

Required tests:

- `const 1 (1 \`div\` 0)` evaluates to `1`
- `let x = 1 \`div\` 0 in 5` evaluates to `5`
- `case (1 \`div\` 0) of ...` errors

Acceptance criteria:

- `hegglog compile Main.hs -o main` produces a native executable for Core-0
  lazy programs
- generated executable links runtime
- lazy semantic wet tests pass

### Phase 9 - ADTs and Pattern Matching

Status: the first executable ADT slice is implemented. `data` declarations now
feed constructor metadata into Core/STG/native compilation; value constructors,
nullary and unary/multi-field constructor applications, case alternatives,
variable patterns, wildcard patterns, literal patterns, nested constructor
patterns, tuple patterns, and list patterns are covered by Core, STG, native,
and wet tests. Guarded RHSs, guarded case alternatives, as-pattern aliases, and
guard-fallthrough no-match behavior are also implemented and wet-tested.
Irrefutable/lazy pattern semantics are implemented for the executable subset;
source-spanned non-exhaustive and redundant pattern-match warnings are exposed
by the typechecker, native API, and compile CLI for the supported finite
constructor/literal/list/tuple executable subset. Core/STG interpreter runtime
failures carry source-defined expression attribution, including nested
subexpression spans that survive lazy thunk allocation and partial application;
broader report-complete pattern coverage remains later work.

Deliverables:

- data declarations and constructors
- constructor, literal, variable, wildcard, nested, tuple, list, and as-patterns
- guards
- pattern-match compiler to Core case

Acceptance criteria:

- `Maybe`, `Either`, and custom ADTs compile
- nested patterns compile
- pattern-bound names scope correctly
- native wet tests cover ADTs, nested patterns, guards, as-patterns, and guard
  fallthrough

### Phase 10 - Lists, Tuples, and Prelude Core

Status: implemented for the supported executable subset. The typechecker,
Core validator/evaluator, STG lowering/evaluator, native LLVM path, and wet
tests now cover built-in list, tuple, unit, `Maybe`, `Either`, and `Ordering`
constructors; list and tuple expressions/patterns/types; short-circuiting
`&&`/`||`; and generated Core bindings for `id`, `const`, `not`, `otherwise`,
`($)`, `(.)`, `flip`, `map`, `foldr`, `foldl`, `head`, `tail`, `null`, `fst`,
`snd`, `length`, `filter`, `reverse`, and `(++)`.

Deliverables:

- unit, tuples, lists, `Maybe`, `Either`, `Bool`, and `Ordering`
- basic Prelude functions
- boolean short-circuit semantics

Acceptance criteria:

- list programs compile
- tuple programs compile
- `map`, `foldr`, `foldl`, `head`, `tail`, `null`, `fst`, `snd`, `length`,
  `filter`, `reverse`, `(++)`, `($)`, `(.)`, and `flip` examples compile
- wet tests cover list recursion and tuple destructuring

### Phase 11 - Recursion

Status: implemented for the supported executable subset. Singleton
self-recursive top-level and local bindings now emit recursive Core groups,
mutual binding groups remain recursive, cons patterns parse as constructor
patterns, and factorial, fibonacci, mutual recursion, guarded self recursion,
recursive list functions, and recursive non-variable pattern bindings are
covered by Core, STG, native, and wet tests.
Nontermination remains isolated to the existing black-hole/runtime tests.

Deliverables:

- recursive top-level functions
- mutually recursive bindings
- recursive local `let`/`where`
- recursive pattern bindings through Core recursive selector groups
- recursive closures/thunks

Acceptance criteria:

- factorial compiles
- fibonacci compiles
- recursive list functions compile
- recursive pattern bindings compile
- nontermination tests are isolated from the normal test suite

### Phase 12 - Type Classes and Dictionary Passing

Status: dictionary representation is implemented for user-defined
single-parameter classes with concrete, context-free instances and for the
first built-in Prelude class slice. Class methods elaborate to selector
functions, instance declarations emit dictionary values, constrained source
functions receive explicit Core dictionary arguments, dictionary values lower
through STG as ordinary constructor/function values, and native wet tests cover
default Egglog and `--no-egglog` execution.
Class constraints are now represented explicitly as a class head plus ordered
argument list; the current executable slice checks the single-argument arity,
normalizes constraint arguments through type synonym expansion, and then feeds
the normalized constraints to defaulting and dictionary elaboration. Constraint
positions outside that executable slice now fail through a structured
placeholder diagnostic, covering superclass contexts, method-specific
constraints, instance contexts, and expression type-signature constraints.
Typecheck diagnostics now preserve source spans through the parsed and renamed
Haskell 2010 AST, and class constraints carry their source attribution so
delayed dictionary failures still render with a concrete source span.

The built-in executable Prelude class slice now supports `Eq Int`, `Eq Bool`,
`Eq Char`, `Ord Int`, `Ord Bool`, `Num Int`, `Real Int`, `Integral Int`,
`Show Int`, `Show Bool`, `Show Char`, exact `Show String`, and generated
structural list `Show`:
`(==)`, `(/=)`, `compare`, `(<)`, `(<=)`, `(>)`, `(>=)`, `max`, `min`, `(+)`,
`(-)`, `(*)`, `negate`, `abs`, `signum`, `fromInteger`, `toRational`,
`quot`, `rem`, `div`, `mod`, `quotRem`, `divMod`, `toInteger`, and `show` lower
through generated dictionaries and selectors. Integer literals elaborate through `fromInteger`,
ambiguous numeric constraints default to the executable `Int` type, structural
`Show [a]` constraints participate in numeric-list defaulting, `Real` and
`Integral` constraints participate in the supported standard-class defaulting
universe, and binding
groups are dependency-sorted before generalization so helper functions can be
specialized by later bindings. TYPE-019 fixes the current MR decision:
unsigned nullary value bindings without signatures can default direct standard
constraints before generalization; signed bindings and functions with value
parameters are protected. `/` is now the Haskell 2010 `Fractional` method;
checked integer division is expressed through `quot`/`rem`/`div`/`mod`.
Remaining Phase 12 work includes instance contexts, method-specific
constraints/type variables, coherence diagnostics, generic `Ratio a` behavior
beyond the current `Ratio Integer`/`Rational` representation, native
out-of-i64 `Integer` payloads, and exact shortest-roundtrip floating lexical
helper polish. Derived `Read` moved to complete with TC-030.

Deliverables:

- class declarations, instance declarations, constraints, and superclasses
- method lookup, dictionary passing, default methods, and basic deriving
- initial `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, and `Num` support

Acceptance criteria:

- `Eq` and `Ord` methods work for supported built-in instances
- executable `Num Int`, `Real Int`, and `Integral Int` methods work through dictionaries
- `Show` works for the supported scalar, string, and list executable subset
- overloaded numeric literals work for supported numeric types
- initial dictionary-passing Core validates for user-defined classes
- native wet tests cover user-defined and built-in typeclass calls

### Phase 13 - IO and `main`

Status: the first IO printing/input slice is implemented for the executable subset.
The typechecker recognizes `IO`, `main :: IO ()`, `putStrLn`, `getLine`, `print`,
`return`, `(>>)`, `(>>=)`, expression `do`, `<-` bind statements, and local
`let`. Core/STG reference evaluators model IO output plus returned action
values for oracle tests, and the native entrypoint executes `IO ()` actions
instead of scalar root printing. Source
string literals and built-in `show`/`shows` results are represented as list-of-`Char`
values, and boxed `Char` values, `Eq Char`, scalar `main :: Char`, Report-shaped
`Show` dictionaries for `Int`/`Bool`/`Char`/`String`/lists support the current
IO subset through default/no-egglog wet tests. Native `getLine` reads stdin
line-by-line, strips line terminators, and returns ordinary `[Char]` strings.
Core, STG, and native IO actions now carry explicit success/failure results:
`fail` raises a catchable user `IOError`, `ioError`, `catch`, and `try` compose
through `System.IO.Error`, and uncaught native IO failures terminate nonzero.
`System.IO` now exposes the Report handle/mode/text IO surface and native
standard-handle text programs cover buffering calls, `hPutStr`/`hPutChar`/
`hPutStrLn`, `hPrint`, `hShow`, line input, `getContents`, and EOF checks.
Native `System.IO` also covers file-backed handle state, open/close,
`readFile`, `writeFile`, `appendFile`, line and character input,
`hLookAhead`, lazy semi-closed `hGetContents`, `hIsEOF`, file sizing and
truncation, `hGetPosn`, `hSetPosn`, `hSeek`, `hTell`, handle predicates, and
productive `fixIO`.

Deliverables:

- `main :: IO ()`
- `print`, `putStrLn`, `getLine`, and do-notation desugaring
- representation for `return`, `(>>=)`, and `(>>)`

Acceptance criteria:

- `main = print 42` compiles and runs
- `main = putStrLn "hello"` compiles and runs
- `main = getLine >>= putStrLn` compiles and reads stdin in native executables
- do notation compiles
- native executable entrypoint uses Haskell `main`

### Phase 14 - Modules and Whole-Program Compilation

Status: completed for the current executable subset. The compiler now loads
same-directory dependency files and ordered CLI `-i`/`--import-path` source
roots from source import declarations, detects module cycles and module-name
mismatches, renames modules in dependency order against actual exported
definitions, enforces explicit export/import filtering including `Thing(..)`
children and hiding, supports qualified aliases, flattens the renamed module
graph into one typed Core program, and selects the root module's `main` as the
native entry point. `MOD-011` and `MOD-012` document the explicit whole-program
compilation boundary and future interface-file requirements. Package databases,
interface-file roots, and remaining standard-library value surfaces remain
later work.

Deliverables:

- module declarations, imports, exports, qualified imports, and hiding
- module graph and cycle detection
- whole-program compilation

Acceptance criteria:

- multiple `.hs` files compile together
- imports resolve
- export lists restrict visibility
- qualified names work
- native wet tests compile multi-module programs

### Phase 15 - Egglog Core Optimizer

Status: the first safe Core optimizer slices are implemented. It optimizes
typed `Int`/`Bool` Core fragments before STG lowering, extracts validating Core,
reports provenance, preserves laziness/bottom by skipping unsafe fragments, and
is checked against Core, STG, and optimized/unoptimized native execution. The
optimizer also folds known literal cases and saturated known-constructor cases
for ADT/list/tuple/dictionary-shaped Core, including constructor-field
projection with tests for unused lazy fields and forced field bottom. The Core
fact analyzer now tracks conservative totality, no-error, demand, demanded
constructor fields, lambda strictness facts, and saturated known dictionary
identities. Known dictionary selector and superclass projections now simplify to
validated dictionary fields, and selected method lambdas beta-reduce under Core
validation. Full Core-native equality-saturation remains part of the full Phase
15 expansion.

Deliverables:

- Core-to-Egglog schema, Core encoding, typed Core facts, Core rewrite rules,
  Core extraction, and provenance/explanations
- facts: `TypeOf`, `Total`, `NoError`, `NonZero`, `NoOverflow`, `KnownConst`,
  `KnownConstructor`, `Demand`, `StrictIn`, and `DictionaryKnown`
- optimizations: constant folding, case-of-known-constructor, constructor
  projection, dictionary simplification, safe arithmetic identities, boolean
  simplification respecting bottom, and guarded dead branch elimination

Acceptance criteria:

- Core optimizer preserves lazy semantics
- bottom/runtime-error behavior is preserved
- extraction produces valid typed Core
- optimized and unoptimized native wet tests agree
- provenance explains selected rewrites

### Phase 16 - Haskell 2010 Surface Completion

Deliverables:

- list comprehensions, arithmetic sequences, and remaining where/declaration
  forms
- record updates over the implemented record labels/selectors/construction/
  pattern subset; partial record construction semantics remain later work
- `newtype`, type synonyms, deriving, and default declarations
- structured foreign declaration frontend support, FFI signature typechecking,
  explicit Core/STG foreign-import IR, native ABI marshalling/lowering, and
  conformance closure; scalar/floating/pointer `foreign import ccall` now has
  native LLVM declaration/call lowering and C-helper wet coverage,
  `Ptr`/`FunPtr` address/pointer ABI support now covers static `&symbol`,
  pointer arguments, and pointer results, `dynamic` imports lower to indirect
  `FunPtr` calls, and `wrapper` imports generate C-callable callback
  trampolines. `foreign export ccall` now emits C-callable native entrypoints
  for supported scalar/floating/pointer pure and `IO` functions, and explicit
  `StablePtr`/manual `ForeignPtr` ownership APIs plus `freeHaskellFunPtr`
  wrapper slot reclamation are implemented and wet-tested. FFI link metadata
  and explicit clang link inputs are implemented and wet-tested. Automatic GC
  finalization remains scoped out under the process-lifetime runtime model

Acceptance criteria:

- conformance matrix reflects implementation
- parser/renamer/typechecker/desugarer tests cover all implemented surface
  features
- native wet tests cover representative programs

### Phase 17 - Diagnostics

Deliverables:

- source spans through frontend
- layout, renamer, typechecker, pattern-match, backend, and runtime diagnostics
- runtime source attribution where possible

Acceptance criteria:

- parse/name/type errors have spans
- runtime errors are useful
- wet tests include diagnostic category checks
- docs show examples

### Phase 18 - CLI Productization

Status: started. `CLI-001`, `CLI-002`, `CLI-003`, `CLI-005`, `CLI-006`, `CLI-007`, `CLI-010`, `CLI-011`, `CLI-012`, and `CLI-016`
are complete: top-level command parsing is centralized in `CLI.Command`,
`Main` dispatches parsed commands, `check` validates through Core/STG without
LLVM/native codegen, `run` compiles to a temporary native executable and
forwards program output, `emit-core` emits validated typed Haskell 2010 Core to
stdout or a file with original/optimized/both selections, `emit-stg` emits
validated Haskell 2010 STG to stdout or a file, `report` emits source-aware
diagnostic/status reports for both legacy `.hg` and Haskell 2010 `.hs` sources,
and `check`/`compile`/`run` support stable `--dump-core`, `--dump-optimized-core`, and `--dump-stg`
diagnostic output on stderr without changing LLVM stdout or program stdout.
Egglog behavior is explicitly controllable with `--no-egglog` and
`--strict-egglog`; strict mode rejects unsupported optimizer fallback paths
instead of silently compiling unoptimized output.
`compile` and `run` also support `--keep-intermediates`, preserving generated
LLVM/object artifacts and run-mode temporary executables under
`.context/hegglog/intermediates`.
`compile` and `report` have scoped help, legacy report and legacy `FILE
--emit-llvm` forms remain supported, and CLI unit/wet tests cover help, error,
check, report, emit-core, emit-stg, strict Egglog, dump flags, kept intermediates, and run
stdout/stderr/exit behavior. Public help text is locked by exact golden
fixtures at both the command-model and executable CLI layers.
The broader command set below remains tracked by the remaining CLI tasks.

Commands:

- `hegglog check Main.hs`
- `hegglog run Main.hs`
- `hegglog compile Main.hs -o main`
- `hegglog report Main.hs`
- `hegglog emit-core Main.hs`
- `hegglog emit-stg Main.hs`
- `hegglog emit-llvm Main.hs`

Flags:

- `--no-egglog`
- `--strict-egglog`
- `--keep-intermediates`
- `--dump-core`
- `--dump-stg`
- `--dump-optimized-core`

Acceptance criteria:

- stable command model
- correct stdout/stderr discipline
- correct exit codes
- CLI wet tests cover common workflows

### Phase 19 - Haskell 2010 Conformance Suite

Status: baseline implemented. The project now has
`test/haskell2010/conformance/manifest.json`, a structured corpus under
`test/haskell2010/conformance/`, and the mandatory
`haskell2010-conformance-test` Cabal suite. The baseline currently records 157
fixtures: 111 native-success cases, 15 native-runtime-error cases, 29 compile-error
cases, and 3 unsupported-documented cases. The suite invokes the built
`hegglog` executable as a subprocess, compiles native-success cases to actual
executables, executes those artifacts directly, compares stdout exactly, checks
runtime-error exits, checks compile-error diagnostics, links manifest-declared
C helper files for FFI fixtures, and fails if documented unsupported cases
silently pass.

Full Phase 19 remains open until the corpus covers every Haskell 2010 Report
feature area deeply enough to support a conformance claim. The current baseline
is a progress-measurement artifact for the implemented executable subset, not a
full Haskell 2010 certification.

Deliverables:

- conformance test corpus for layout, expressions, declarations, patterns,
  ADTs, class/instance behavior, modules, Prelude, IO, runtime/laziness
- structured manifest with expected status, expected stdout or diagnostic
  category, required compiler stage, and notes/deviations
- Cabal test-suite wiring so conformance runs under `cabal test all`

Acceptance criteria:

- every conformance matrix row links to tests or a documented deviation
- no undocumented failures
- unsupported features remain explicit conformance cases until implemented

### Phase 20 - Release Quality

Deliverables:

- CI matrix, LLVM/clang docs, runtime build integration, installation docs,
  examples gallery, docs index, standard library layout, formatting/linting,
  benchmark suite, and release checklist

Acceptance criteria:

- fresh checkout builds
- CI runs unit/property/golden/wet tests
- user can install and compile a Haskell 2010 subset program
- package metadata is clean

## Parallel Workstreams

- Frontend team: Haskell 2010 lexer, layout, parser, pretty-printer, and
  frontend diagnostics. Boundary: emits source AST only.
- Type system team: renamer, HM inference, constraints, type classes, and
  dictionary-passing design. Boundary: emits typed Core and diagnostics.
- Core/Egglog team: Core syntax, validation, facts, CoreEgglog adapter, rules,
  extraction, and provenance. Boundary: Egglog kernel remains frontend
  independent.
- Runtime/STG team: lazy STG-like IR, thunk/closure runtime, constructor
  representation, update/black-hole behavior, and runtime tests.
- Backend team: STG-to-LLVM lowering, runtime linking, native executable
  output, and target-specific validation.
- Testing team: conformance matrix, unit/property/golden tests, native wet
  tests, negative diagnostics, and CI coverage.
- Documentation team: roadmap, specs, status reports, examples, and documented
  deviations.

## Immediate Next Chunks

### Source Surface Closure

This chunk is complete. SURFACE-003 added report-shaped line-broken `where`
layout coverage for function bindings and case alternatives, including native
positive fixtures and stable parse-error fixtures for misindented `where`
keywords.
SURFACE-002 is complete: user-defined symbolic and backtick operator bindings,
local fixities, non-built-in infix calls, and Prelude-shadowing operators now
compile through native execution and have manifest-backed fixtures.

TEST-CONF-014 is complete: expression, declaration, and pattern matrix rows now
have manifest-backed closure entries, and the conformance validator enforces
that source-surface fixtures stay represented in the matrix.

### Prelude, Deriving, And Typeclass Library Completion

This is the following chunk once the source surface has been closed. The goal
is to make the standard library and derived-instance behavior look like Haskell
2010 rather than a narrow executable subset:

1. LIB-001 through LIB-012 — implement the numbered standard-library module
   gaps produced by the TEST-CONF-015 reconciliation, starting with
   `Control.Monad`, `Data.List`, `Data.Maybe`, `Data.Char`, `Data.Ratio`, and
   `Numeric` now that the Read method shape is in place.

This chunk must not treat the current generated library modules as the end
state. They are importable checkpoints on the path to the full Haskell 2010
Report surface, and unsupported Report modules or values must stay explicit in
the tracker, conformance matrix, and generated module boundary.
TEST-CONF-015 is complete: the library closure table is now validator-backed,
and every Report library group has manifest-backed coverage plus numbered
remaining tasks.

### Remaining FFI Closure

The FFI is no longer tracked as a whole-feature documented deviation. The
current scalar/floating/pointer/static/dynamic/wrapper/export/stable-pointer slice is
implemented, and the remaining work is now split into dedicated tasks:

FFI-010 is complete for native ABI marshalling of `Float`, `Double`,
`CFloat`, and `CDouble` across static calls, dynamic calls, wrapper callbacks,
and foreign export entrypoints.

FFI-011 is complete for preserving header/symbol link metadata and for passing
explicit native link objects, libraries, library paths, and frameworks through
the CLI/toolchain to clang.

FFI-012 is complete for explicit callback/finalizer lifetime behavior:
`freeHaskellFunPtr` releases wrapper slots, double-free is idempotent,
callback-after-free aborts, freed slots are reclaimed, and manual `ForeignPtr`
finalizers remain explicit/idempotent with reverse-order dispatch under the
process-lifetime runtime model.

1. FFI-013 — Foreign library surface completion. Status: complete for the
   generated/importable `Foreign`, `Foreign.C`, `Foreign.C.Error`,
   `Foreign.C.String`, `Foreign.C.Types`, `Foreign.Ptr`,
   `Foreign.StablePtr`, `Foreign.ForeignPtr`, `Foreign.Marshal`,
   `Foreign.Marshal.Alloc`, `Foreign.Marshal.Array`,
   `Foreign.Marshal.Error`, `Foreign.Marshal.Utils`, and
   `Foreign.Storable` surface that fits the current native runtime model.
   The previous errno, Storable, raw allocation, array marshalling, and
   C string marshalling gaps now have Core/STG/native lowering and native
   conformance fixtures in default and no-egglog modes.

Completed immediate tasks:

- MOD-009 instance import/export behavior, including `ModuleInterface`
  instance propagation, `import M ()`/empty-export instance visibility,
  transitive import-chain instance movement, Core dictionary availability,
  native conformance coverage, and a negative fixture proving class/type imports
  alone do not make unrelated instances visible.
- PRELUDE-017 standard library module layout, including a dedicated
  `Haskell2010.StandardLibrary` module, generated/importable `Prelude`
  interface, shared `ModuleInterface` data model, and instance-export boundary
  used by MOD-009.
- PRELUDE-020 standard library module expansion, including generated/importable
  interfaces for `Control.Monad`, `Data.Int`, `Data.List`, `Data.Maybe`, `Data.Char`,
  `Data.Word`, `System.IO`, and implemented `Foreign.*` module slices, with
  `Control.Monad` exposing real `Functor(fmap)` support for `[]`, `Maybe`, and
  `IO`, source-backed Report APIs for `Data.List`, `Data.Maybe`, and
  `Data.Char`, and reserved Report modules kept unimportable until real support
  exists.
- PRELUDE-002/MOD-010 implicit Prelude import behavior, including synthetic
  `import Prelude` insertion only when no explicit `Prelude` import exists,
  explicit Prelude import-list/hiding/qualified filtering, and native
  conformance coverage for implicit, explicit, and qualified Prelude imports.
- Commit roadmap pivot.
- TC-023 derived Eq, including generated `Eq` dictionaries for supported data/newtype declarations and structural list `Eq`.
- TC-024 derived Ord, including generated `Ord` dictionaries, `Eq` superclass dictionaries, and structural list/string ordering.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- The target is Haskell 2010.
- The compiler emits native executables.
- LLVM is the machine-code path.
- Egglog remains central.
- Laziness must be implemented.
- Bottom/runtime-error behavior must be preserved.
- Every phase has wet tests.
- No feature is complete until parsed, renamed, typechecked, desugared,
  compiled where applicable, and tested.
- GHC extensions are excluded initially.
- GHC compatibility is not claimed.
- The current `.hg` compiler remains the substrate.
- Parallel agents must work against documented IR boundaries.

## Definition of Success

The Haskell 2010 compiler succeeds when `hegglog compile Main.hs -o main` works
for the documented Haskell 2010 feature set, producing a native executable
whose behavior matches the implemented Haskell 2010 semantics.
