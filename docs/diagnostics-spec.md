# Diagnostics Specification

This document describes the diagnostic format currently emitted by Haskell Compiler's
user-facing `.hg` compile paths and records the diagnostic requirements for the
planned Haskell 2010 frontend.

## Source Locations

Source ranges are rendered as:

```text
path:start-line:start-column-end-column
path:start-line:start-column-end-line:end-column
```

Columns are 1-based. Same-line ranges omit the ending line number. The ending
column is the Megaparsec position immediately after the final token in the
range.

The parser produces a parallel located AST. The unspanned `Expr` AST remains the
semantic input for ANF, interpreters, optimizers, and backend lowering.

## Parser Diagnostics

The legacy `.hg` parser still reports Megaparsec `ParseErrorBundle` output. It
includes the source path, line, and column reported by Megaparsec, followed by
the parser's expected-token summary.

Example:

```text
examples/bad.hg:1:4:
  |
1 | let
  |    ^
unexpected end of input
expecting letter or '_'
```

The Haskell 2010 frontend normalizes parse and lexical failures through
`Haskell2010.Diagnostics.renderParseDiagnostic` before they escape native
compilation or module-graph loading. These diagnostics use the same one-line
source-range shape as later compiler phases:

```text
Main.hs:2:8-9: Haskell 2010 parse error: unexpected 'q' expecting ...
```

When Megaparsec reports more than one parse failure, each failure is rendered as
one source-spanned diagnostic line.

## Layout Diagnostics

The Haskell 2010 layout parser validates implicit `let`, `where`, `do`, and
`case ... of` blocks against the layout keyword's reference column. Misaligned
items that are still indented inside the block produce explicit layout
diagnostics instead of falling through to unrelated token expectations.

Example:

```text
Main.hs:5:6-7: Haskell 2010 layout error: layout item is indented to column 6; expected column 7 for another item, or column 3 or less to close the block
```

## Typechecker Diagnostics

Type errors use the located AST and identify the smallest practical source
construct that explains the failure.

Examples:

```text
examples/type-errors/add-bool.hg:1:5-9: type error: operator + expects Int operands, got Bool
examples/type-errors/if-non-bool.hg:1:4-5: type error: if condition must be Bool, got Int
```

The CLI report mode wraps these lines in a section header:

```text
== Type error ==
examples/type-errors/add-bool.hg:1:5-9: type error: operator + expects Int operands, got Bool
```

## Kind Diagnostics

Haskell 2010 kind failures use the same source-span mechanism as type errors,
but render with `kind error` severity so partial type-constructor application and
higher-kinded class-argument mistakes are distinguishable from ordinary term
type mismatches.

Example:

```text
Main.hs:5:8-12: kind error: kind mismatch: expected *, got * -> *
```

## Class And Instance Diagnostics

Haskell 2010 class-constraint failures render with `class error` severity.
Explicit constraint positions report the offending constraint span, while
dictionary obligations created by overloaded variable use preserve the source
span of that use site.

Example:

```text
Main.hs:7:15-30: class error: unsolved type-class constraint Measure Box
```

Instance declaration conflicts and malformed instance bodies render with
`instance error` severity. Explicit instance declarations carry their
declaration span, and duplicate/overlapping built-in or user instances are
represented by structured typechecker errors instead of generic unsupported-form
messages.

Example:

```text
Main.hs:3:1-9:1: instance error: duplicate built-in instance for `Monad IO`
```

## Module And Import Diagnostics

Haskell 2010 import declarations carry source spans from parsing through module
graph loading and import-list resolution. Missing source modules and missing
exported names selected by explicit import lists render with `module/import
error` severity at the import declaration that caused the failure.

Examples:

```text
Main.hs:3:1-21: module/import error: could not read Haskell 2010 module `MissingModule`: no source file found; searched: ./MissingModule.hs
Main.hs:2:1-29: module/import error: module `Prelude` does not export term name `notExported`
```

## Runtime Diagnostics

Haskell 2010 Core and STG interpreter diagnostics preserve source attribution
for source-defined runtime closures and nested source expressions. When a
forced top-level binding fails through a helper binding, the runtime error is
reported at the helper expression rather than only at the requested entry point.
Expression spans survive typed elaboration, Core optimization, STG lowering,
lazy thunk allocation, and partial-application thunks so delayed failures use
the innermost surviving source span. The attribution uses the same one-line
`runtime error` diagnostic shape as the rest of the compiler.

Example:

```text
<haskell2010-renamer-test>:2:9-16: runtime error: division by zero
```

## LLVM Diagnostics

The LLVM compile path typechecks the located source first, then rejects source
constructs known to be outside the current LLVM fragment before lowering to ANF.
This gives unsupported-feature errors source ranges instead of backend-only ANF
shapes.

Examples:

```text
LLVM backend cannot print function-valued root expression of type (Int -> Int)
```

The current LLVM source-fragment rejections are:

- function-valued root expressions
- partial or over-applied top-level calls
- using a top-level function as a first-class value

Closed first-order source that passes this check can still fail later backend
validation if an internal lowering bug constructs invalid ANF, backend IR, or
LLVM IR.

## Test Coverage

Diagnostic behavior is covered by:

- parser source-location smoke tests
- golden type-error diagnostics
- golden LLVM unsupported-feature diagnostics
- existing negative type fixtures in `examples/type-errors/`

## Haskell 2010 Diagnostic Requirements

The Haskell 2010 target will need additional diagnostic classes:

- layout parse errors
- renamer errors
- type inference errors
- class and instance errors
- pattern-match errors
- module/import errors
- runtime source attribution for lazy evaluation
- source spans through Core/STG where possible

Current status: Haskell 2010 parse/lex errors are normalized into one-line
source-spanned diagnostics on native and module-loading paths. Implicit layout
failures in `let`, `where`, `do`, and `case ... of` blocks are classified as
layout errors with explicit indentation expectations. Kind mismatches render as
source-spanned `kind error` diagnostics. Class constraints and instance
declaration failures render as source-spanned `class error` and `instance error`
diagnostics for the executable subset. Module graph and explicit import-list
failures render as source-spanned `module/import error` diagnostics at the
responsible import declaration. Core and STG interpreter runtime failures carry
top-level source binding attribution for source-defined closures. The parser,
renamer, typechecker, class/instance, and runtime no-matching-alternative
errors exist for the executable subset, and guard fallthrough is covered by
Core/STG/native tests.
The Haskell 2010 typechecker now emits source-spanned warnings for supported
non-exhaustive `case`, function, and lambda pattern matches, including finite
constructor witnesses such as `False` or `Nothing` where the checker can
identify them. It also emits source-spanned redundant-alternative warnings for
supported unreachable alternatives. Native compilation carries those warnings
through `Haskell2010LLVMResult`, and the CLI renders them to stderr before
emit/build/run output. Core and STG runtime diagnostics now retain nested
source-expression spans through lazy evaluation and partial application. The
existing located `.hg` parser/typechecker and LLVM unsupported-source
diagnostics are the carry-forward baseline.
