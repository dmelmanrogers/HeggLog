Pass/fail summary: `haskell2010-conformance-test` passed. The current compiler
passes the documented executable-subset conformance cases. Full Haskell 2010
conformance remains incomplete, and unsupported features are represented as
explicit conformance cases rather than omitted.

LIB-001 through LIB-012 audit checkpoint: the implemented library tasks
`LIB-001` through `LIB-012` are covered by the tracker, matrix, manifest,
validators, and the full Cabal test suite. `LIB-011` is now covered by native
generated-module fixtures for `System.Environment` and `System.Exit`.
`System.Environment` exposes `getArgs`, `getProgName`, and `getEnv` against
native process arguments and environment variables, including catchable
`DoesNotExistError` failures for missing variables. `System.Exit` exposes
`ExitCode(ExitSuccess, ExitFailure)`, `exitWith`, `exitFailure`, and
`exitSuccess`; valid exit actions propagate as non-catchable process termination
with the requested process status, while the POSIX-prohibited `ExitFailure 0`
path is a catchable illegal-operation `IOError`.

LIB-012 is now covered by unit and conformance paths for the native Haskell
2010 text IO runtime model. `System.IO` exposes the Report
handle/mode/buffering/seek/text IO surface at the generated interface and
typechecking boundaries; Core, STG, native lowering, validators, and the
optimizer all recognize the expanded primitive set. Native conformance now
includes `io.system-io` and `io.system-io-files`, which exercise standard
handles, file-backed handles, open/close, `readFile`, `writeFile`,
`appendFile`, buffering metadata, line and character input, `hLookAhead`,
lazy semi-closed `hGetContents`, `hIsEOF`, `hFileSize`, `hSetFileSize`,
`hGetPosn`, `hSetPosn`, `hSeek`, `hTell`, handle predicates, `hPrint`,
`hShow`, and productive `fixIO` in default and `--no-egglog` modes.

FFI-011 is now covered by the conformance/native path. Header-qualified static
`ccall` imports preserve link metadata, C helper fixtures are linked through
the `haskell-compiler compile --link-object` path, and the unit suite covers LLVM link
metadata comments plus missing link-input diagnostics.

FFI-012 is now covered by native unit and conformance paths. `freeHaskellFunPtr`
is imported through the generated `Foreign`/`Foreign.Ptr` surface, wrapper
slots are reclaimed after explicit release, double-free of a wrapper pointer is
idempotent, callback-after-free exits nonzero, and manual `ForeignPtr`
finalization remains explicit, idempotent, and reverse-order under the
process-lifetime runtime model. The new `ffi.wrapper-reclamation` and
`ffi.wrapper-after-free` fixtures run in default and `--no-egglog` modes.

TEST-CONF-014 source matrix closure is now validator-backed. The conformance
validator checks 37 declaration/expression/pattern closure rows, rejects fixture
paths not present in the manifest, and rejects any `declarations`,
`expressions`, or `patterns` manifest fixture omitted from the closure table.
It also requires the source-surface negative and unsupported fixtures introduced
for malformed where layout, misindented line-broken where keywords, duplicate
binders, impossible patterns, unsupported constraint positions, and FFI shape
boundaries to stay linked from the closure table.

SURFACE-002 is now covered by native and negative conformance fixtures:
`expressions.user-defined-operators` checks symbolic and backtick value
operators, local fixity, and Prelude-shadowing `(++)`;
`negative.constructor-operator-binding` rejects colon-prefixed constructor
operators in value-binding syntax.

SURFACE-003 is now covered by native and negative conformance fixtures:
`expressions.where-layout` checks report-shaped line-broken `where` groups on
function bindings and case alternatives; `negative.misindented-where-keyword`
rejects a line-broken `where` at the enclosing declaration column.

TC-031 is now covered by native, runtime-error, and negative conformance
fixtures. `typeclasses.derived-enum` checks generated `Enum` dictionaries for
nullary-constructor data declarations, declaration-order constructor indices,
`succ`/`pred`, `toEnum`/`fromEnum`, range methods, and source range syntax.
`typeclasses.derived-enum-runtime-error` checks bounds failure at runtime, and
`negative.derived-enum-field-constructor` rejects non-enumeration deriving.

TC-032 is now covered by native and negative conformance fixtures.
`typeclasses.derived-bounded` checks generated `Bounded` dictionaries for
all-nullary enumerations, single-constructor products, records, and newtypes,
including field-wise `minBound`/`maxBound` dictionaries. The negative
`derived-bounded-mixed-constructors` fixture rejects declarations that are
neither enumerations nor single-constructor shapes.

TC-033 is now covered by native and negative conformance fixtures.
`prelude.numeric-hierarchy` checks executable `Real Int` and `Integral Int`
dictionaries for `toRational`, `quot`, `rem`, `div`, `mod`, `quotRem`,
`divMod`, `toInteger`, and supported `Integer` default declarations in default
and `--no-egglog` modes. The negative `invalid-default-type` fixture rejects a
non-numeric default declaration with an explicit diagnostic.

TC-030 is now covered by native conformance fixtures. `prelude.read-standard`
checks `ReadS`, `readsPrec`, `readList`, `reads`, `read`, `lex`, `readParen`,
standard supported `Read` instances, partial-read behavior, and token-boundary
rejection. `typeclasses.derived-read` checks generated `Read` dictionaries for
nullary constructors, products, records, recursive data, newtypes, `String`
fields, list-backed contexts, and precedence-sensitive nested constructor
parsing in default and `--no-egglog` modes.

PRELUDE-009 is now covered by native conformance and e2e fixtures.
`prelude.foldl` checks generated `foldl` for left-to-right accumulator order,
polymorphic accumulator/list element types, empty-list behavior, and lazy
ignored accumulator arguments in default and `--no-egglog` modes.

PRELUDE-019 is now covered by native conformance and e2e fixtures.
`prelude.functions` checks generated `($)`, `(.)`, `flip`, `head`, `tail`,
`null`, `fst`, and `snd` through Core/STG/native execution, including function
composition/application, list selectors, pair selectors, list null checks, and
String output as `[Char]`. `prelude.head-empty` locks the partial-selector
boundary by requiring empty-list `head` to compile and fail at native runtime in
default and `--no-egglog` modes.

PRELUDE-020 is now covered by native conformance and e2e fixtures.
`modules.standard-library-modules` checks generated/importable interfaces for
`Data.List`, `Data.Maybe`, `Data.Char`, `Control.Monad`, and `System.IO` with explicit
import lists, `Functor(fmap)` and `Maybe(..)` child exports, imported fixities,
ordinary Prelude-backed semantics, and default plus `--no-egglog` native execution. The
unsupported package/database fixture imports unimplemented `Data.Set` so
unimplemented standard-library modules continue to fail explicitly.

MOD-003 is now covered by unit, conformance, and native e2e fixtures.
`modules.import-search-path` compiles a root `Main` module whose dependency is
outside the root module directory and supplied through an ordered `-i` source
root. The native default/`--no-egglog` and emit-LLVM wet paths also pass the
same cross-directory source import through the CLI. Package databases,
interface-file roots, and unimplemented library modules remain documented
separately from source import path support.

LIB-002 is now covered by native conformance and e2e fixtures.
`modules.data-list` compiles a source-backed virtual `Data.List` module through
the ordinary module graph, parser, renamer, typechecker, Core/STG lowering, and
native backend. The fixture exercises transformations, folds/scans, map
accumulators, sublists, searches, indexing, zips/unzips, text helpers, set-like
operations, `By` variants, ordered-list helpers, and generic functions in
default, `--no-egglog`, and emit-LLVM modes. `modules.data-list-partial` locks
empty-list partial selector behavior with a native runtime-error case.

LIB-003 is now covered by native conformance and e2e fixtures.
`modules.data-maybe` compiles a source-backed virtual `Data.Maybe` module
through the ordinary module graph, parser, renamer, typechecker, Core/STG
lowering, and native backend. The fixture exercises `Maybe(..)`, `maybe`,
`isJust`, `isNothing`, `fromJust`, `fromMaybe`, `maybeToList`, `listToMaybe`,
`catMaybes`, and `mapMaybe` in default, `--no-egglog`, and emit-LLVM modes.
`modules.data-maybe-partial` locks `fromJust Nothing` as a native runtime-error
case.

LIB-004 is now covered by native conformance and e2e fixtures.
`modules.data-char` compiles a source-backed virtual `Data.Char` module through
the ordinary module graph, parser, renamer, typechecker, Core/STG lowering, and
native backend. The fixture exercises `GeneralCategory(..)`, classification
predicates, case conversion, digit conversion, `ord`, `chr`, `showLitChar`,
`lexLitChar`, and `readLitChar` in default, `--no-egglog`, and emit-LLVM modes.
`modules.data-char-partial` locks invalid `digitToInt` input as a native
runtime-error case. The implementation documents its compact character-table
policy instead of claiming an untested full Unicode database.
`modules.data-bits` now positively checks the generated `Data.Bits` module,
the Haskell 2010 `Bits` method surface, `Bits Int`, checked shift/rotate
semantics, and emit-LLVM lowering. `modules.data-bits-negative-shift-partial`
locks directional negative bit counts as native runtime errors.

LIB-007 is now covered by native conformance and e2e fixtures.
`modules.data-ratio` checks the generated `Data.Ratio` module, `Ratio` and
`Rational` imports, normalized `(%)`, `numerator`, `denominator`,
`approxRational`, Prelude `toRational`, and built-in `Ratio Integer`
`Eq`/`Ord`/`Num`/`Real`/`Show`/`Read` behavior in default, `--no-egglog`, and
emit-LLVM modes. `modules.data-ratio-zero-denominator-partial` locks zero
denominator handling as a native runtime-error case.

TEST-CONF-015 is now validator-backed. The conformance matrix contains a
Library Conformance Closure table covering Chapter 9 Prelude areas and every
Part II Libraries module group. The conformance validator now checks all 18
library closure rows, verifies that each row cites manifest-backed fixtures and
numbered remaining tracker tasks, and requires the library closure fixtures to
stay represented in the matrix. The former FFI-013 reserved Report modules now
have positive native fixtures: `Foreign.C.Error`, `Foreign.C.String`,
`Foreign.Marshal.Alloc`, `Foreign.Marshal.Array`, and `Foreign.Storable` moved
from documented gaps to generated/native coverage. `System.Environment`,
`System.Exit`, and `Numeric` have also moved from the reserved set to
native/generated or source-backed fixtures.
`modules.data-complex` and `prelude.floating-numeric` now positively check
the LIB-008 floating numeric tower and importable `Data.Complex` module in
default and `--no-egglog` native modes.
`io.io-error` now positively checks the generated `System.IO.Error` surface for
recoverable `IOError` behavior, and `modules.standard-library-scalar-types`
positively checks the generated `Data.Int`, `Data.Word`, and `Foreign.C.Types`
scalar type-name surface.

LIB-009 is now covered by native conformance fixtures. `modules.data-int-word`
checks real fixed-width `Data.Int`/`Data.Word` runtime behavior across modulo
overflow, signed and unsigned bounds, unsigned `Word64` rendering, quotient and
remainder, `Bits`, oversized signed/unsigned shifts, rotates, `Enum`, `Ix`,
`Read`, and `Show` in default and `--no-egglog` modes.
`ffi.fixed-width-scalars` checks static C marshalling for `Int8`, `Word8`, and
`Word64`, while `negative.ffi-word-not-basic` keeps plain `Word` rejected as a
non-basic Haskell 2010 FFI type.

`ffi.foreign-library-surface` positively checks the implemented `Foreign.Ptr`, `Foreign.ForeignPtr`,
`Foreign.Marshal.Error`, and `Foreign.Marshal.Utils` surface in native default
and `--no-egglog` modes. `ffi.foreign-storable`,
`ffi.foreign-marshal-array`, `ffi.foreign-c-string`, and
`ffi.foreign-c-error` positively check typed memory access, raw allocation,
array marshalling, C/CW string conversion, all Report errno constants,
`Errno(Errno)`, retry/may-block/path errno guards, and errno behavior in both
compiler modes. `ffi.floating-ccall` positively checks
`Float`/`Double`/`CFloat`/`CDouble` FFI marshalling across static calls,
dynamic calls, wrapper callbacks, and foreign export entrypoints.
