# Haskell Compiler Roadmap

The authoritative project roadmap is now
[Haskell Compiler Roadmap: Haskell 2010 Native Compiler](haskell2010-roadmap.md).

## Active Target

Haskell Compiler is a Haskell 2010 native compiler project implemented in Haskell. The
active target is Haskell 2010 source compiled to native machine-code
executables through LLVM and clang.

The current strict `.hg` compiler is the backend/middle-end substrate and
regression baseline. It is not the final source-language endpoint. The Haskell
2010 path now compiles the documented executable subset, while the full
Haskell 2010 surface remains roadmap work.

## Current `.hg` Compiler Baseline

Implemented and tested for the current `.hg` compiler-supported subset:

- parser, typechecker, and report/interpreter mode
- ANF and resolved ANF
- Egglog backend for supported typed strict ANF fragments
- checked signed `Int64` semantics
- ordered top-level first-order functions
- lambda lifting for eligible non-capturing lambdas
- closure conversion for supported local function values
- Backend IR and LLVM IR generation
- native executable output through `clang`
- mandatory end-to-end wet tests of native artifacts
- CI build/test/package checks and wet-test execution

For the detailed current support matrix, see
[current-capabilities.md](current-capabilities.md).

## Immediate Next Tasks

The authoritative queue is the Haskell 2010 task tracker. The source-surface
chunk is complete: SURFACE-001, SURFACE-002, and SURFACE-003 are implemented
and covered by parser/renamer/Core/STG/native tests plus manifest fixtures.
The next chunk is Prelude, deriving, and typeclass library completion.

TEST-CONF-014 source matrix closure is complete and now enforced by the
conformance validator.

The next library chunk is the numbered LIB follow-ups from TEST-CONF-015;
TC-029 is complete for Report-shaped `Show`, and TC-030 is complete for
Report-shaped `Read`.
PRELUDE-019 is complete for the current high-value function slice, and
PRELUDE-020 is complete for the current generated standard-library module
interface slice. TEST-CONF-015 is complete: Chapter 9 Prelude and the Part II
Haskell 2010 Libraries module inventory are reconciled against manifest-backed
coverage and numbered remaining tasks. FFI-010 is complete for floating-point
FFI marshalling across static calls, dynamic calls, wrapper callbacks, and
foreign export entrypoints. FFI-011 is complete for FFI link metadata and
explicit native link inputs. FFI-012 is complete for explicit wrapper
callback/finalizer lifetime behavior: `freeHaskellFunPtr`, slot reclamation,
callback-after-free rejection, idempotent double-free, and reverse-order manual
ForeignPtr finalization are covered. FFI-013 is complete for the previously
documented errno, Storable, allocation, array, and C-string library gaps.

Completed Haskell 2010 roadmap work:

- MOD-009 instance import/export behavior: implemented with source instance
  propagation through `ModuleInterface`, empty export-list and `import M ()`
  visibility, transitive import-chain dictionary availability, native
  conformance coverage, and a negative missing-instance import fixture.
- PRELUDE-017 standard library module layout: implemented with a dedicated
  `Haskell2010.StandardLibrary` module, generated/importable `Prelude`
  interface, shared `ModuleInterface` data model, and instance-export boundary
  used by MOD-009.

  importable interfaces for `Control.Monad`, `Data.Int`, `Data.List`,
  `Data.Maybe`, `Data.Char`, `Data.Word`, `System.IO`, and implemented `Foreign.*` module
  slices, including real `Functor(fmap)` support for `[]`, `Maybe`, and `IO`,
  plus source-backed Report APIs for `Data.List`, `Data.Maybe`, and `Data.Char`,
  while keeping reserved Report modules unimportable until they have real support.

  conversion.
- FFI-012 callback and finalizer lifetime completion: implemented

## Non-Negotiable Project Direction

- The source-language target is Haskell 2010.
- The compiler emits native executables.
- LLVM is the machine-code path.
- Egglog optimization remains central.
- Laziness must be implemented for Haskell 2010.
- Bottom/runtime-error behavior must be preserved.
- Current `.hg` functionality remains preserved as substrate and regression
  coverage.
- GHC compatibility is not claimed.
