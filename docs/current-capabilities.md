# Current Capabilities

This document describes what Haskell Compiler can do today and separates current `.hg`
support from the active Haskell 2010 target.

## Current Native Compiler Capability

The current compiler-supported source language is the strict Haskell Compiler `.hg`
subset. For that subset, Haskell Compiler can:

- parse source files
- typecheck and elaborate source
- run report/interpreter mode
- lower to ANF and resolved ANF
- infer analysis facts
- optimize supported typed strict ANF through the Egglog backend
- lower to Backend IR
- emit LLVM IR
- build native executables through `clang`
- execute native artifacts under mandatory wet tests

The `haskell-compiler` executable now has a single normalized command parser for the
supported top-level commands: `haskell-compiler check FILE ...`, `haskell-compiler run FILE
...`, `haskell-compiler emit-core FILE ...`, `haskell-compiler emit-stg FILE ...`,
`haskell-compiler compile FILE ...`, `haskell-compiler report FILE`, and the legacy
`haskell-compiler FILE` report/interpreter form.
`check` parses, renames, typechecks, optimizes according to the selected Egglog
mode, and validates Core/STG without LLVM or native code generation and without
requiring a root `main` binding. `emit-core` reuses that validation pipeline and
emits typed Haskell 2010 Core to stdout or a file, with `--original`,
`--optimized`, and `--both` selections for typechecker Core versus checked
post-optimizer Core. For legacy `.hg`, `emit-core` exposes the existing lowered
legacy Core IR without changing report/interpreter behavior. `emit-stg` uses
the same Haskell 2010 validation path and emits checked STG to stdout or a file
for runtime/backend debugging; legacy `.hg` sources are rejected because that
frontend has no STG layer.
`report` emits source-aware diagnostic/status output: legacy `.hg` reports keep
the parser/typechecker/interpreter/ANF/facts/rewrite/EGraph/Egglog/Core report,
while Haskell 2010 `.hs` reports run the check pipeline and render stable source,
warning, optimization, typed Core, and STG sections. Report mode accepts
`--no-egglog`, `--strict-egglog`, and repeated Haskell 2010 import paths.
`run` compiles through the normal native pipeline into a temporary executable,
forwards program stdout/stderr without build chatter, and exits with the
program status. Egglog optimization is explicitly controllable: `--no-egglog`
disables it, while `--strict-egglog` requires optimizer support and fails
instead of falling back to unoptimized ANF/Core for nontrivial unsupported input.
`check`, `compile`, and `run` also expose stable debug dump flags:
`--dump-core`, `--dump-optimized-core`, and `--dump-stg`. These dump original
typed Core, optimized typed Core, and validated STG to stderr with stable
section headers, keeping generated LLVM stdout and program stdout
machine-readable. `compile` and `run` support `--keep-intermediates`, preserving
debug artifacts under `.context/haskell-compiler/intermediates`; native keep mode writes
the generated LLVM, compiles a real object file, and links the executable from
that object, while `run` also preserves its normally temporary executable.
General, check, emit-core, emit-stg, run, compile, and report help are stable
stdout-producing commands covered by exact public golden fixtures; malformed
command lines produce diagnostics and scoped usage text on stderr before exiting
nonzero.

The native executable path supports checked signed `Int64` arithmetic,
checked division, conditionals, top-level first-order direct calls,
lambda-lifted non-capturing lambdas, and closure-converted local function
values where the program root is printable.

## Current Source Language

The current compiled source is the strict Haskell Compiler `.hg` subset. It is not
Haskell 2010.

Implemented `.hg` source forms:

- `Int` and `Bool` literals
- variables
- nonrecursive `let`
- `if`
- integer `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- integer `<`
- `==` over `Int` and `Bool`
- lambda expressions
- function application
- ordered nonrecursive top-level first-order definitions
- optional lambda parameter annotations when monomorphic inference is concrete
- local higher-order functions through closure conversion

Not implemented in the current `.hg` language:

- Haskell 2010 layout
- modules and imports
- ADTs
- pattern matching
- type classes and instances
- Prelude/library surface
- IO `main`
- lazy semantics
- GHC extensions

## Haskell 2010 Target Status

Haskell 2010 compilation is the active roadmap. A Haskell2010 parser/layout
frontend now exists and produces an isolated source AST, and the renamer now
produces a unique-name resolved AST with lexical scopes, namespace separation,
import ambiguity checks, and fixity resolution. An isolated typed Core IR,
validator, free-variable pass, substitution pass, and pretty-printer now exist
and are unit-tested. A Haskell typechecker/desugarer now emits validating typed
Core for the current executable subset: `Int`, `Bool`, functions, lazy
lets/arguments, user `data` declarations, polymorphic constructors, constructor
cases, lazy constructor fields, nested constructor patterns, list and tuple
syntax/patterns/types, built-in `Maybe`, `Either`, `Ordering`, and generated
Core Prelude bindings for basic list/Bool functions, plus recursive top-level
and local functions, plus the initial type class dictionary slice for
user-defined single-parameter classes, concrete instances, explicit source
constraints with normalized argument representation, dictionary-passed method
calls, superclass dictionary fields/projection, default class methods,
derived `Eq`/`Ord`/Report-shaped `Show` dictionaries for supported data/newtype declarations including
parameterized, recursive, `String`-field, list-backed, record, and precedence-sensitive cases,
derived `Enum` dictionaries for nullary-constructor data declarations,
derived `Bounded` dictionaries for all-nullary enumerations and
single-constructor products, records, and newtypes,
overlapping-instance rejection, structured placeholder diagnostics for remaining unsupported constraint contexts,
source-spanned typecheck diagnostics including delayed dictionary failures,
documented nullary-binding monomorphism/defaulting behavior, boxed `Char`
literals and literal cases, scalar `main :: Char` output, and built-in
`Eq Int`, `Eq Bool`, `Eq Char`, structural `Eq [a]`, `Ord Int`, `Ord Bool`, `Ord Char`, structural `Ord [a]`, executable `Num Int`, executable `Real Int`, and executable `Integral Int`
class methods, plus guarded RHSs, guarded case alternatives, as-pattern
aliases, and guard-fallthrough no-match behavior, plus the standard-handle IO
printing/input slice for `IO`, `main :: IO ()`,
`putStrLn`, `putStr`, `putChar`, `getLine`, `getContents`, `print`, and `System.IO`
handle text operations plus file-backed handles, seek/position, semi-closed
lazy `hGetContents`, and productive `fixIO`, and higher-kinded `Monad` dictionaries for
`IO`, `Maybe`, and lists, including `return`, `(>>)`, `(>>=)`, `fail`, generic
expression and bind-statement `do` sequencing, refutable do-bind failure, and
recoverable `IOError` behavior through `ioError`, `catch`, and `try`, and
built-in Report-shaped `Show Int`/`Show Bool`/`Show Char`/`Show String` plus generated
structural list `Show` dictionaries and Prelude `shows`, plus executable arithmetic sequences over
`Int`, `Char`, and derived-enumeration ranges, public `Enum Int`/`Enum Char` and
`Bounded Int`/`Bounded Char`/`Bounded Bool` dictionaries, plus executable list comprehensions with generator
scoping, Bool guards, `let` qualifiers, nested generators, and refutable
pattern filtering. A Core
reference evaluator executes validating typed Core with erased type
abstraction/application, checked `Int` primitives, and structured runtime
errors. An isolated STG-like IR, validator, and pure heap evaluator now model
the lazy runtime MVP with updateable thunks, single-entry thunks, sharing,
black-hole detection, constructor case dispatch, constructor field binding,
list/tuple/Prelude constructor dispatch, and checked primitives. Core-to-STG
lowering now translates validating Core modules
into validating STG while preserving lazy semantics. The Haskell 2010 native
path now emits LLVM for the current executable subset using boxed values,
updateable and single-entry thunks, function closures, enter/apply, Bool,
user-constructor, list, tuple, `Maybe`/`Either`/`Ordering` case dispatch,
boxed constructor field arrays, process-lifetime heap allocation through
`haskell_compiler_hs_alloc_process_lifetime` under the documented no-free/no-GC
ownership policy, boxed `Char` values, `Eq Char` primitive lowering, scalar
`Char` root printing, source `String` literals as ordinary list-of-`Char`
constructor values, and checked primitive aborts, then uses the existing clang
toolchain path to produce native executables. The Haskell 2010 native path also
executes `main :: IO ()` actions for `putStrLn`, `putStr`, `putChar`, `getLine`,
`getContents`, `print`, standard-handle `hPutStr`/`hPutChar`/`hPutStrLn`, `hPrint`,
`hSetBuffering`, `hIsEOF`, and `hShow` using
list-of-`Char` traversal, built-in scalar/string `Show` results represented as
lists, generated list `Show` dictionaries, Monad-backed do-bind result values,
explicit `(>>=)`, explicit IO success/failure wrappers, catchable `failIO#`,
`ioError`, `catch`, `try`, and a compatibility path for legacy internal string
payloads. Dedicated
native wet tests now cover direct string output, list operations over strings,
show-produced strings, explicit `Char` cons patterns, and string literal
patterns, plus `Int`/`Char` arithmetic sequences, list comprehensions, and
Monad IO/Maybe/list do-notation in both default and `--no-egglog` modes.
Static `foreign import ccall` declarations now lower through Core/STG foreign
IR to native LLVM external declarations and direct calls for the supported
scalar, floating, and pointer ABI slice: boxed `Int`/`Bool`/`Char`/`Float` and
`Double`, boxed `Ptr`/`FunPtr`, static `&symbol` data and function addresses,
signed and unsigned integer C ABI declarations, `CFloat`/`CDouble` ABI
declarations, checked integer marshalling, floating-point marshalling, pointer
arguments/results, and result-carrying `IO` sequencing. `dynamic` imports now
lower to indirect `FunPtr` calls, and `wrapper` imports now generate C-callable
callback trampolines backed by reclaimable process-lifetime closure slots.
`freeHaskellFunPtr` releases wrapper slots, double-free is idempotent for
wrapper pointers, callback-after-free aborts, and later wrapper allocations can
reuse freed slots. `foreign export ccall` declarations now lower to C-callable native LLVM entrypoints for the
supported scalar/floating/pointer ABI slice; entrypoints allocate the module
closure graph, box C arguments, enter the exported Haskell closure, force pure
or `IO` results, and marshal results back to C. Native wet tests link generated
LLVM against C helper files and check side-effect ordering, pointer mutation,
floating-point round trips, indirect function-pointer calls, Haskell callbacks
re-entering boxed closures, and C helpers calling exported Haskell entrypoints.
Explicit `StablePtr` ownership
and manual `ForeignPtr` finalizer APIs are implemented with native wet coverage:
stable pointers can be created, dereferenced, cast to raw pointers, cast back,
and explicitly freed, while foreign pointers own raw addresses, accept bounded
process-lifetime finalizer lists, support `withForeignPtr`, and finalize
idempotently with reverse-order finalizer dispatch. `Foreign.Ptr` also exposes null and representation-preserving
pointer/function-pointer casts plus `freeHaskellFunPtr`; `Foreign.ForeignPtr` exposes
`FinalizerPtr`/`FinalizerEnvPtr`, `unsafeForeignPtrToPtr`, and
`castForeignPtr`; `Foreign.C.Error`, `Foreign.C.String`,
`Foreign.Marshal.Alloc`, `Foreign.Marshal.Array`, and `Foreign.Storable`
cover all Report errno constants, `Errno(Errno)`, `isValidErrno`,
errno access/reset, retry/may-block/path errno guards, C/CW string conversion,
raw allocation, array marshalling, and typed memory peek/poke; and
`Foreign.Marshal.Error`/`Foreign.Marshal.Utils` expose guard and `Maybe`
pointer helpers. FFI link metadata is now
preserved through native compilation: header-qualified imports, static/address
symbols, and export symbols appear in the Haskell 2010 LLVM result and emitted
LLVM comments, while the CLI/toolchain accepts explicit `--link-object`,
`--link-library`, `--library-path`, and `--framework` inputs for clang.
Automatic GC finalizer scheduling remains outside the current process-lifetime
runtime claim; the prior errno, Storable, raw allocation, array marshalling,
and C string marshalling gaps are implemented and native-tested.
Multi-module Haskell 2010 compilation now also follows the Report's special
instance import/export rule for the executable source-instance subset:
instances move across empty export lists, empty import lists, and transitive
import chains independently of ordinary name filtering.
The module compilation boundary is explicit in
`Haskell2010.ModuleGraph.currentModuleCompilationBoundary`: current imports
use root-directory-first source search, generated standard-library interfaces,
and ordered CLI `-i`/`--import-path` source roots; current compilation is
whole-program source-graph compilation, and persistent interface files are
intentionally deferred until package/interface identity is stable.
The Haskell 2010
native path now runs an Egglog Core optimizer by
default for safe typed Core fragments before STG lowering; `--no-egglog`
disables that optimizer for comparison and debugging. The optimizer covers
safe Core-0 `Int`/`Bool` fragments plus known literal and saturated
known-constructor case/projection rewrites for ADT/list/tuple/dictionary-shaped
Core while preserving lazy constructor fields and forced bottom behavior.
Haskell 2010 conformance is now tracked by a dedicated mandatory suite backed
by `test/haskell2010/conformance/manifest.json`; the current compiler passes
the documented executable-subset cases, while incomplete Haskell 2010 features
are represented as explicit failing or unsupported-documented fixtures. The
Prelude/typeclass surface now includes Report-shaped `Show` and `Read` for the
supported executable subset, including `ReadS`, lexical read parsing, standard
supported instances, and derived `Read`.

  provenance reporting, lazy let preservation, lazy constructor-field
  preservation, strict bottom preservation, and optimized/unoptimized native

- Haskell 2010 conformance suite: implemented as
  `haskell2010-conformance-test`; it contains 157 manifest-tracked fixtures with
  111 native-success cases, 15 native-runtime-error cases, 29 compile-error

  `Monad(..)`, `MonadPlus(..)`, and Report monadic combinators for supported
  `[]`, `Maybe`, and `IO` dictionaries; `Data.Char` is a source-backed module
  with Report classification, conversion, digit, ordinal, and literal-helper
  APIs under the documented compact character-table policy; `Data.Int` and
  `Data.Word` have real fixed-width runtime representations, numeric/class
  dictionaries, and native scalar FFI coverage for the Report fixed-width
  foreign types; broader standard
  modules remain reserved and documented in
  [haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md](haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md)

Progress is tracked in
[haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md](haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md).

## Current Next Focus

The next coherent chunk is Prelude, deriving, and typeclass library completion.
SURFACE-001 completed the current source-surface audit and matrix
reconciliation, SURFACE-002 completed user-defined operator bindings and infix
calls, SURFACE-003 completed line-broken `where` layout coverage, DIAG-009
completed supported-subset pattern-match diagnostics, TEST-CONF-013 completed
source-surface negative fixtures, TEST-CONF-014 completed machine-checked
source matrix closure, and ADT-007 completed record
update expressions.

The following coherent chunk is Prelude, deriving, and typeclass library
completion: the numbered LIB follow-ups from TEST-CONF-015.
PRELUDE-019 and PRELUDE-020 are complete for the current high-value function
and standard-module interface slices. TEST-CONF-015 is complete for
validator-backed reconciliation against Chapter 9 Prelude and the Part II
Haskell 2010 Libraries module inventory. FFI-010 is complete for floating-point
native ABI marshalling of `Float`, `Double`, `CFloat`, and `CDouble`; FFI-011
is complete for link metadata and explicit native link inputs; FFI-012 is
complete for explicit callback/finalizer lifetime behavior; and FFI-013
implements the Foreign library surface that fits the current native runtime
model, including errno, Storable, allocation, array, and C-string pieces.
MOD-011 and MOD-012 are complete as a documented module-compilation boundary:
the current compiler is intentionally whole-program over loaded source modules,
and future interface files must wait for stable search-path and dependency
fingerprint semantics.

## Carry-Forward Infrastructure

The current `.hg` compiler provides reusable compiler infrastructure for the
Haskell 2010 target:

- LLVM backend structure
- native executable toolchain integration through `clang`
- Backend IR validation patterns
- closure conversion infrastructure
- checked arithmetic/division runtime handling
- Egglog kernel
- current ANF Egglog backend as optimizer prototype
- provenance/debug tracing
- mandatory wet-test framework
- CI build/test/package checks

The future Haskell 2010 pipeline must keep these boundaries clean: the
Haskell2010 frontend emits typed Core, the Core Egglog adapter optimizes typed
Core, the STG/runtime layer implements laziness, and LLVM remains the native
machine-code path.

## Testing

Current tests include:

- parser, typechecker, interpreter, ANF, optimizer, Egglog, backend, LLVM,
  golden, and property tests
- native executable tests in the normal Cabal suite
- `e2e-wet-test`, included in `cabal test all`, which invokes the built
  `haskell-compiler` CLI, compiles real `.hg` and executable-subset `.hs` files,
  checks help/error stdout and stderr discipline, checks no-codegen validation
  for `.hg` and Haskell 2010 library modules, checks `emit-core` stdout/file
  output for validated typed Haskell 2010 Core sections, checks `emit-stg`
  stdout/file output and legacy `.hg` rejection, checks dump flag stderr output
  and stdout preservation for check/compile/run, checks `--keep-intermediates`
  LLVM/object/executable preservation, checks `--strict-egglog` success and
  fallback rejection behavior, checks top-level `run` stdout, stderr, and
  nonzero-exit behavior, executes native artifacts, verifies
  stdout/stderr/exit codes, compares report-mode `Result: <value>` output,
  runs Haskell 2010 default Egglog and
  `--no-egglog` native cases including ADT, list, tuple, Prelude, recursive
  programs, user-defined type class dictionary programs, derived `Eq`/`Ord`/`Show`/`Enum`/`Bounded`
  programs, and built-in `Eq`/`Ord`/`Num`/`Fractional`/`Floating`/`RealFrac`/`RealFloat`/`Show`/`Enum`/`Bounded` dictionary programs, `Data.Complex` programs, numeric-defaulting and
  monomorphism/defaulting decision programs, multi-file module programs,
  implicit, explicit, and qualified Prelude import programs,
  known-constructor optimizer programs, plus line-oriented and standard-handle IO
  printing/input and recoverable IO-error programs, and compiles selected emitted LLVM through `clang`
- `haskell2010-conformance-test`, included in `cabal test all`, which reads the
  JSON conformance manifest, invokes the built `haskell-compiler` executable as a
  subprocess, compiles native-success cases to actual executables, executes
  those artifacts directly, compares stdout exactly, verifies runtime-error
  cases exit nonzero, verifies compile-error diagnostics, and ensures
  unsupported-documented cases fail explicitly rather than silently passing

Future Haskell 2010 conformance work should extend this direct executable
coverage as report-complete pattern coverage/runtime attribution, broader
Unicode/string escape edge cases, and additional string library behavior are
implemented. Native `System.IO` coverage now includes file-backed handles, true
seeking and position state, lazy semi-closed contents, and productive `fixIO`.
Source-spanned
non-exhaustive and redundant pattern warnings are already exposed through the
Haskell 2010 typechecker, native compilation result APIs, and compile CLI.
