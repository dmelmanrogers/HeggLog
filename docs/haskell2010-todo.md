# HeggLog Haskell 2010 Compiler To-Do List

HeggLog is building a Haskell 2010 native-code compiler implemented in Haskell. The current `.hg` compiler remains the backend/middle-end substrate and regression baseline. This backlog tracks the work required to compile Haskell 2010 source programs to native executables through LLVM, with Egglog optimization over typed Core.

This document is the authoritative engineering backlog. The matching machine-readable index is `docs/haskell2010-todo.json`, and `scripts/validate-haskell2010-todo.py` fails if JSON and markdown task IDs, titles, statuses, or categories drift.

# Dependency Graph

- Parser/layout -> renamer -> typechecker -> Core -> STG -> runtime/LLVM -> native wet tests
- ADTs -> pattern matching -> lists/tuples -> Prelude -> type classes -> IO
- Core -> Egglog Core optimizer -> optimized native wet tests
- Modules-lite -> full modules -> Prelude import behavior -> conformance closure
- Diagnostics spans -> parser/renamer/typechecker/backend/runtime diagnostics

# Parallelization Plan

- Frontend agent: FRONT and REN tasks.
- Type system agent: TYPE and TC tasks.
- Core agent: CORE and desugaring tasks.
- Runtime/STG agent: STG and RTS tasks.
- Backend agent: LLVM tasks.
- Egglog agent: EGG-CORE tasks.
- Testing agent: TEST-CONF, wet tests, property tests.
- Docs/release agent: DOC, REL, README, matrix updates.

Rules:
- each agent works only against documented IR boundaries
- each task must update tests
- each task must update the conformance matrix
- no agent changes another subsystem's invariants without updating docs and tests
- every merged task must pass full validation

Keep the work behind the IR/API boundary named by this category and update conformance status rather than claiming broader support.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

- `test/Main.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- fixity declaration parser is implemented, completed, or explicitly documented according to status `complete`.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- parser unit tests

- Milestone M4 (HM typechecker). The typechecker now represents `*`, kind arrows, rendered kinds, derived kind arity, and type-constructor info for user and supported built-in type constructors. TYPE-012 builds on this with source type-expression kind inference/checking.

## TYPE-012 — kind inference/checking

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- CORE-002
- CORE-003

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver kind inference/checking for HM typechecker while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Keep the work behind the IR/API boundary named by this category and update conformance status rather than claiming broader support.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Core/Syntax.hs`
- `test/Main.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- kind inference/checking is implemented, completed, or explicitly documented according to status `complete`.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- typechecker unit tests
- negative type tests
- dictionary/Core validation tests
- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M4 (HM typechecker). The typechecker now infers and checks `*` and arrow kinds for supported source monotypes, constructor fields, signatures, and constraints. It infers higher-kinded data parameters from constructor field use, rejects partial or over-applied type constructors before Core generation, and TYPE-013 expands type synonyms before Core conversion. Broader class typing and later surface features remain tracked by their dedicated tasks.

## TYPE-013 — type synonym expansion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- CORE-002

- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M4 (HM typechecker). Type synonyms now carry inferred kinds, are rejected when recursive, and expand structurally in signatures, constructor fields, constraints, instance heads, and default declarations before Core conversion. Higher-kinded synonym parameters are inferred through the same kind machinery as data parameters.

Acceptance criteria:
- Runtime ownership documentation enumerates process-lifetime allocation classes and non-owned runtime values.
- The leak policy explicitly states that generated native programs may retain runtime allocations until process exit and currently emit no `free`, finalizers, reference counting, tracing GC, or sweep phase.
- Native LLVM shape tests assert direct `malloc` calls stay inside allocation helpers for both the strict `.hg` and Haskell 2010 STG backends.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- runtime unit tests
- native runtime wet tests
- runtime-error conformance tests

Documentation updates:

Acceptance criteria:
- Record update syntax is represented in parsed and renamed Haskell 2010 ASTs without being confused with record construction.
- The typechecker validates update labels against the scrutinee record type, rejects ambiguous updates, and reports missing-field or non-record diagnostics with source spans.
- Record updates lower to validating Core/STG and execute natively for the supported ADT/newtype record subset while preserving laziness of untouched fields.
- Positive and negative conformance fixtures cover construction, selection, pattern matching, update, ambiguous labels, duplicate update fields, and invalid fields.
- The conformance matrix distinguishes record declarations/selectors/construction/patterns from record updates.

Required tests:
- parser tests
- renamer tests
- typechecker negative tests
- Core/STG validation tests
- native wet/conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Added or refreshed by the tracker reconciliation audit so future work has a stable task ID instead of living only in roadmap prose.
- Implemented as a distinct source and renamed AST form, parsed as postfix record-update syntax after atomic expressions while keeping constructor record syntax separate.
- Typechecking resolves labels through record selectors, rejects duplicate labels, rejects labels drawn from multiple datatypes, reports concrete wrong-record/non-record scrutinees at the update span, and lowers valid updates to typed Core cases that reconstruct only constructors containing all updated labels.
- Runtime constructors in the datatype that do not provide all updated labels intentionally have no generated case alternative, so they fail at runtime as required by Haskell 2010. Untouched fields are forwarded via case binders to preserve laziness.
- Covered by parser tests plus native, runtime-error, and negative conformance fixtures in the manifest and reflected in the conformance matrix.

## SURFACE-001 — source surface audit and matrix reconciliation

Status:
- complete

Category:
- testing

Depends on:
- FRONT-020
- REN-009
- CORE-017
- PAT-012
- CORE-REC-003
- CORE-REC-004
- TEST-CONF-001

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Audit every currently parsed expression, declaration, local declaration, and pattern form against parser, renamer, typechecker, Core/STG lowering, native execution, and conformance matrix status.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Audit every currently parsed expression, declaration, local declaration, and pattern form against parser, renamer, typechecker, Core/STG lowering, native execution, and conformance matrix status.
- Where implementation already exists, add missing native, Core/STG, or negative fixtures before upgrading matrix rows.
- Where implementation is absent, leave an explicit unsupported-documented fixture or a stable follow-up task ID.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- tracker audit script
- conformance manifest review
- targeted source-surface fixtures

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-status-summary.md`

Notes:
- Completed by auditing parsed source-surface forms against parser, renamer, typechecker, Core/STG lowering, native execution, conformance matrix status, and manifest coverage. Added native conformance fixtures for where groups, top-level pattern bindings, local fixity plus expression type signatures, and unit/wildcard patterns. Negative source-surface breadth is covered by TEST-CONF-013, source matrix closure is completed by TEST-CONF-014, and record updates are tracked separately by completed ADT-007.

## SURFACE-002 — user-defined operator bindings and infix calls

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- FRONT-003
- FRONT-019
- REN-009
- TYPE-007
- CORE-016

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Parenthesized symbolic value bindings and backtick value operators resolve as ordinary term binders where Haskell 2010 permits them.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Parenthesized symbolic value bindings and backtick value operators resolve as ordinary term binders where Haskell 2010 permits them.
- User-defined infix applications elaborate through ordinary function application when the resolved operator is not a built-in special form.
- Local fixity declarations apply to user-defined symbolic and backtick operators through parser, renamer, typechecker, Core/STG, and native execution.
- Unsupported or malformed operator binding shapes report stable parser, renamer, or typechecker diagnostics instead of falling through to generic unsupported Core forms.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix and manifest distinguish built-in operator support from user-defined operator support.

Required tests:
- parser and renamer operator binding tests
- typechecker/Core/STG/native user-defined infix tests
- negative operator binding and fixity diagnostics
- conformance manifest fixtures

Documentation updates:
- docs/haskell2010-todo.md
- docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md
- docs/haskell2010-status-summary.md

Notes:
- Complete. User-defined symbolic and backtick value operators now parse as ordinary binary function bindings, constructor-operator binding syntax is rejected at parse time, and non-built-in infix applications typecheck by elaborating through ordinary function application. Local fixity declarations apply through renaming, Core/STG/native execution, and the wet fixture also locks local shadowing of Prelude `(++)` so built-in special-casing cannot steal user-defined operators.
## SURFACE-003 — where layout position coverage

Status:
- complete

Category:
- frontend

Depends on:
- FRONT-001
- FRONT-020
- REN-009
- CORE-017

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Function-binding and case-alternative where groups parse when the where keyword appears on the following layout line in report-shaped source.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:

- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Function-binding and case-alternative where groups parse when the where keyword appears on the following layout line in report-shaped source.
- Accepted where groups continue to rename, typecheck, lower through Core/STG, and compile natively for the executable subset.
- Malformed where/layout combinations produce stable parse diagnostics and negative conformance fixtures.
- The conformance matrix explicitly separates implemented where semantics from remaining layout-position gaps.

Required tests:
- parser layout tests
- native conformance fixtures for report-shaped where layout
- negative malformed where/layout fixtures

Documentation updates:
- docs/haskell2010-todo.md
- docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md
- docs/haskell2010-status-summary.md

Notes:
- Complete. Function-binding and case-alternative `where` groups now parse when the `where` keyword appears on the following layout line, while a line-broken `where` at the enclosing declaration/alternative column is rejected as a parse error. The coverage runs through parser tests, Core/STG/native unit examples, e2e wet tests, native conformance fixtures, and negative malformed-layout fixtures.

Broader `String = [Char]` and Unicode/output-library behavior remain tracked by later M10 and Prelude/IO tasks.

## PRELUDE-DATA-007 — String = [Char]

Status:
- complete

- IO-009
- IO-010
- IO-011
- IO-012
- IO-013
- IO-014

Scope:
- Source string literals and string literal patterns desugar to ordinary `[]`/`(:)` lists of boxed `Char` before Core. Core and STG evaluators produce list-of-`Char` values for source strings and built-in `show` results, and native LLVM emits list constructors rather than generated per-literal string payload globals. `putStrLn` continues to consume list-of-`Char` values while retaining the legacy internal string payload path for compatibility with older direct STG forms.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

- `test/Main.hs`
- `test/e2e/programs/haskell2010/string-char-list.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- Source string expressions elaborate to list constructors, not Core/STG string payload literals.
- String literal patterns elaborate through ordinary list-pattern matching.
- `length "..."`, `length (show 42)`, and native execution of the same program pass through Core, STG, and LLVM.
- Native LLVM no longer emits generated `@haskell2010_str_` globals or calls the special string payload allocator for source string literals.

Required tests:
- library unit tests
- Prelude conformance tests
- native wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/current-capabilities.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M10 (Lists, tuples, Char, String). Completed with source `String` literals and string literal patterns represented as ordinary `[Char]` values across typechecking, Core evaluation, STG evaluation, native LLVM, conformance, and wet tests. Broader Unicode text IO, exhaustive escape fidelity beyond the current parser/runtime subset, and additional string/list library behavior remain tracked by later Prelude/IO tasks.

## PRELUDE-DATA-008 — arithmetic sequences

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- ADT-001
- PAT-004

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver the executable arithmetic sequence surface for supported `Int`, `Char`, and generated derived-enumeration ranges while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Public `Enum` dictionaries are tracked under TC-018, and derived `Enum` range behavior is now completed under TC-031.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M10 (Lists, tuples, Char, String). Completed for the executable subset with `[a..]`, `[a,b..]`, `[a..z]`, and `[a,b..z]` over `Int`, `Char`, and generated derived `Enum` dictionaries; sequence helpers preserve ascending/descending bounded behavior and lazy open-range consumption through Core, STG, and native LLVM. TC-018 reuses these helpers for the public `Enum Int` and `Enum Char` dictionaries, and TC-031 routes derived-enumeration ranges through the same `Enum` method surface.

Notes:
- Milestone M10 (Lists, tuples, Char, String). Completed for the executable subset with list comprehension parsing, generator-binder renamer scoping, Bool guards, `let` qualifiers, nested generators, tuple/list/constructor/literal/refutable pattern filtering, and Core/STG/native execution. The lowering uses local recursive list walkers with accumulator tails, so output order is preserved without requiring a separate append helper. Native wet tests cover `Int` and `Char` range generators, `String` results, `Maybe` pattern filters, tuple patterns, nested refutable patterns, and local let qualifiers.

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:

- Native example execution covers `putStrLn (show 42)` and `putStrLn (show False)`.
- Native example execution covers explicit `Char` cons patterns and string literal patterns over source string values.
- E2E wet tests run the new string fixtures in default and `--no-egglog` modes with emit-LLVM coverage.

Scope:
- Broaden the supported `Show` surface beyond the original exact `Int`/`Bool` dictionaries while preserving explicit dictionary passing. The implemented executable subset now includes exact `Show Char`, exact `Show String` with quoted string output, a generated structural `Show a => Show [a]` dictionary, nested list/string output such as `[String]`, `print` through the broadened dictionaries, and numeric-list defaulting for examples like `show [1, 2, 3]`.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- Built-in `Show Char` and `Show String` dictionaries typecheck, elaborate to Core dictionaries, evaluate through Core/STG, and run natively.
- Generic structural `Show a => Show [a]` dictionary synthesis supports `Show [Int]`, `Show [Bool]`, and nested `Show [String]` without finite ad hoc list instances.
- `print` uses the broadened dictionaries for `Char` and `String`.
- Numeric-list defaulting supports `show [1, 2, 3]` in the executable `Int` subset.
- Haskell 2010 conformance and e2e wet tests cover the broadened Show surface in default and `--no-egglog` native modes.

Required tests:

TC-029 later promoted this surface to the Report-shaped `showsPrec`/`show`/`showList` hierarchy with derived constructor precedence and supported lexical escaping.

## TC-016 — Close Read documented deviation

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TYPE-016
- CORE-009

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Close the historical Haskell 2010 `Read` documented deviation now that TC-030 has implemented coherent `ReadS`/lexical parser support, `readsPrec`/`readList` methods, standard supported instances, and derived `Read` synthesis. The tracker, matrix, docs, and conformance suite must no longer present `Read` as an active unsupported/deviation boundary.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

Acceptance criteria:
- TC-016 is marked complete rather than documented deviation.
- Read is no longer listed as an active Haskell 2010 Prelude/typeclass deviation.
- The old unsupported Read conformance fixture is removed and replaced by positive standard and derived Read coverage.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to TC-030 for implemented Read work and to concrete LIB tasks for remaining library gaps.

- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M11 (Type classes and dictionaries). Complete. TC-016 is closed as an active deviation: `Read` is no longer represented as unsupported in the current Haskell 2010 tracker, matrix, or conformance manifest. TC-030 owns the implemented Read surface, including `Read` dictionaries, lexical read helpers, standard supported instances, and derived `Read`; the old unsupported fixture has been replaced by positive native conformance coverage.

The implementation follows Haskell 2010 declaration-order constructor comparison and lexicographic product-field comparison, emits `Eq` superclass dictionaries, supports parameterized and recursive instances, handles `String` fields through structural `Ord [a]`, and generates `compare`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `max`, and `min` methods for the executable subset.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.

Complete for the current executable subset: supported data/newtype declarations can derive `Ord` when an `Eq` superclass dictionary is available, and structural list ordering supports string and list-backed fields. Derived `Show` is covered by TC-025, derived `Read` by TC-030, derived `Enum` by TC-031, and derived `Bounded` by TC-032.

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TYPE-016
- CORE-009

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver derived `Show` for the supported Type classes and dictionaries executable subset while preserving the current `.hg` substrate. The compiler synthesizes ordinary `Show` dictionaries for supported `data` and `newtype` declarations, including nullary constructors, product constructors, records, recursive data, `String` fields, list-backed contexts, and parameterized instances.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Core/Syntax.hs`
- `test/Main.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- derived `Show` is implemented for the supported executable subset and represented in unit, native, and conformance coverage.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- typechecker unit tests
- negative type tests
- dictionary/Core validation tests
- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M11 (Type classes and dictionaries). Complete for the derived executable subset: generated `Show` dictionaries return ordinary `[Char]` values and compose through the structural list/string `Show` surface. TC-029 later promoted derived `Show` to the Report-shaped `showsPrec`/`show`/`showList` hierarchy, so product-field parentheses now follow the active precedence context instead of the former conservative rendering.

## TC-026 — class negative tests

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TYPE-016
- CORE-009

Blocks:

Keep the work behind the IR/API boundary named by this category and update conformance status rather than claiming broader support.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.

## TC-027 — dictionary Core validation tests

Status:
- complete

Category:

Depends on:

## TC-028 — typeclass native wet tests

Status:

## TC-029 — report-shaped Show hierarchy

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TC-015
- TC-025
- PRELUDE-DATA-007

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- `Show` exposes and uses the Haskell 2010 method shape around `showsPrec`, `show`, `showList`, and `shows` without breaking existing executable `show` and `print` behavior.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:

- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Show` exposes and uses the Haskell 2010 method shape around `showsPrec`, `show`, `showList`, and `shows` without breaking existing executable `show` and `print` behavior.
- Generated and built-in Show dictionaries implement precedence-sensitive constructor rendering and report-compatible character/string/list escaping for the supported value surface.
- Derived `Show` uses the same method hierarchy instead of a separate string-only path.
- Native and conformance tests cover scalar, list, string, product, record, recursive, and precedence-sensitive output.
- The matrix no longer describes full `showsPrec`/`showList` as future work once this task is complete.

Required tests:
- typechecker unit tests
- dictionary/Core validation tests
- native wet tests
- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. The generated Prelude now exposes `shows` and the `Show` class uses
  the Report-shaped `showsPrec`, `show`, and `showList` dictionary layout.
  Built-in `Show Int`, `Show Bool`, `Show Char`, exact `Show String`,
  generated structural list dictionaries, and supported derived data/newtype
  dictionaries all use the same method hierarchy. Derived product constructors
  honor application precedence, nested constructor fields use `showsPrec 11`,
  records render with record-construction syntax, `ShowS` continuations are
  respected for lists, and native/conformance coverage locks scalar, list,
  string, product, record, recursive, precedence-sensitive, and supported
  escaping behavior.

## TC-030 — Read implementation

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TC-016
- TC-029
- PRELUDE-DATA-007

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- `Read` is promoted from documented deviation to implemented class support with `ReadS`, `readsPrec`, `readList`, `reads`, and `read` where required by the Report surface.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:

- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Read` is promoted from documented deviation to implemented class support with `ReadS`, `readsPrec`, `readList`, `reads`, and `read` where required by the Report surface.
- Lexical read parsing accepts report-compatible whitespace and token forms for supported scalar, list, tuple, and ADT values.
- Built-in and derived `Read` dictionaries lower through Core/STG/native using the same dictionary model as other classes.
- Invalid and partial reads have documented behavior and conformance fixtures.
- The existing unsupported `Read` fixture is removed or converted only when replacement positive and negative coverage exists.

Required tests:
- typechecker unit tests
- parser/lexer read tests
- dictionary/Core validation tests
- native wet tests
- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M11 (Type classes and dictionaries). Complete for the current executable subset: the generated Prelude exposes `ReadS`, `readsPrec`, `readList`, `reads`, `read`, `lex`, and `readParen`; built-in dictionaries cover `Int`, `Bool`, `Char`, `String`, structural lists, `Ordering`, and unit; derived `Read` synthesizes dictionaries for supported data/newtype declarations including nullary constructors, products, records, recursive data, `String` fields, list-backed contexts, and precedence-sensitive nested constructors. Core/STG/native unit tests and manifest-backed native fixtures cover successful parsing, partial-read behavior, token-boundary rejection, and derived constructor parsing. Remaining richer numeric read helpers and broader library exports stay owned by their LIB tasks.

## TC-031 — derived Enum

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TC-018
- ADT-001

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Derived `Enum` is generated for eligible nullary-constructor data declarations with Haskell 2010 constructor ordering semantics. Generated dictionaries implement `succ`, `pred`, `toEnum`, `fromEnum`, `enumFrom`, `enumFromThen`, `enumFromTo`, and `enumFromThenTo`; source arithmetic-sequence syntax dispatches through the same `Enum` methods so user-derived enumeration ranges run through Core, STG, and native LLVM.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Derived `Enum` is generated for eligible nullary-constructor data declarations with Haskell 2010 constructor ordering semantics.
- Generated dictionaries implement `succ`, `pred`, `toEnum`, `fromEnum`, and enumeration methods with correct bounds/error behavior for the supported runtime.
- Invalid deriving cases, including constructors with fields and unsupported declaration shapes, fail with stable diagnostics.
- Native and conformance fixtures cover positive and negative derived `Enum` cases.
- The matrix records both public built-in `Enum` instances and generated derived `Enum` dictionaries.

Required tests:
- typechecker unit tests
- negative type tests
- dictionary/Core validation tests
- native wet tests
- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. Nullary-constructor data declarations can derive `Enum`; the generated dictionaries use declaration-order constructor indices, report-shaped `succ`/`pred`/`toEnum` bounds errors, `fromEnum`, and range methods based on `map toEnum` over integer ranges. The compiler rejects derived `Enum` for constructors with fields, and unit, conformance, e2e, default Egglog, and `--no-egglog` native coverage now lock the behavior down.

## TC-032 — derived Bounded

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TC-019
- ADT-001

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Derived `Bounded` is generated for eligible all-nullary enumerations, single-constructor product types, records, and supported newtype shapes according to Haskell 2010 rules.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:

- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Derived `Bounded` is generated for eligible all-nullary enumerations, single-constructor product types, records, and supported newtype shapes according to Haskell 2010 rules.
- Generated dictionaries implement `minBound` and `maxBound` with constructor-order and field-bound semantics where applicable.
- Invalid deriving cases fail with stable diagnostics.
- Native and conformance fixtures cover positive and negative derived `Bounded` cases.
- The matrix records both public built-in `Bounded` instances and derived `Bounded` support.

Required tests:
- typechecker unit tests
- negative type tests
- dictionary/Core validation tests
- native wet tests
- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. All-nullary data declarations derive `Bounded` by selecting the first and last constructors in declaration order. Single-constructor product, record, and newtype declarations derive `minBound`/`maxBound` by applying the constructor to field-wise `minBound`/`maxBound` calls, which produces ordinary field `Bounded` constraints for parameterized products. Mixed or multi-constructor non-enumeration declarations are rejected with a stable diagnostic, and Core, STG, native, e2e, default Egglog, `--no-egglog`, and conformance fixtures cover the positive and negative paths.

## TC-033 — numeric class hierarchy expansion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- typechecker

Depends on:
- TC-017
- TC-021
- TC-022

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Broaden the numeric class hierarchy beyond the current executable `Num Int` path, including the standard superclass/method relationships needed for Haskell 2010 numeric code.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:

- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Broaden the numeric class hierarchy beyond the current executable `Num Int` path, including the standard superclass/method relationships needed for Haskell 2010 numeric code.
- Defaulting follows Haskell 2010 rules for the expanded numeric universe and keeps the current checked-runtime guarantees for bounded executable `Int` behavior.
- Unsupported numeric types or methods have explicit diagnostics rather than silent fallback.
- Core/STG/native and conformance fixtures cover overloaded literals, default declarations, numeric methods, and invalid ambiguity cases.
- Docs clearly separate implemented numeric support from remaining arbitrary-precision or floating behavior.

Required tests:
- typechecker unit tests
- numeric defaulting tests
- dictionary/Core validation tests
- native wet tests
- conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/type-inference.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. The built-in numeric hierarchy now includes report-shaped `Real`
  and `Integral` classes above the existing executable `Num Int` path. The
  `Int` dictionaries implement `toRational`, `quot`, `rem`, `div`, `mod`,
  `quotRem`, `divMod`, and `toInteger`, with Core/STG/native lowering for a
  checked remainder primitive and Haskell 2010 `quot`/`rem` versus `div`/`mod`
  semantics. Defaulting recognizes `Real` and `Integral` constraints in the
  supported standard-class numeric universe, `Integer` defaults now select the
  distinct `Integer` type, and invalid default declarations remain explicit
  compile errors. Core and STG execution carry arbitrary-precision `Integer`
  values through host `Integer` semantics; native LLVM still uses the existing
  i64 boxed payload path for `Integer` values and rejects out-of-payload
  literals explicitly instead of silently truncating them. Fractional and
  floating behavior are covered by `LIB-008`/`LIB-010`; `LIB-007` now supplies
  the current `Ratio Integer`/`Rational` representation used by `toRational`.

## PRELUDE-001 — Prelude module strategy

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- PRELUDE-DATA-003

## PRELUDE-002 — implicit Prelude import

Status:

Acceptance criteria:
- implicit Prelude import is implemented for the built-in Prelude surface: modules
  without an explicit `Prelude` import are renamed as if they had `import
  Prelude`, and any explicit `Prelude` import suppresses that implicit import.
- Explicit Prelude import lists, empty import lists, `hiding`, duplicate imports
  of the same entity, and `qualified` imports are handled by the same import
  filtering rules used for ordinary modules.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.

  Prelude surface: renamer tests cover implicit, explicit, qualified,
  cumulative, and duplicate Prelude imports; conformance fixtures cover native
  implicit/explicit/qualified Prelude imports and negative empty/qualified
  unqualified-name failures.

## PRELUDE-019 — Prelude function completion

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.

Acceptance criteria:
- Fill high-value missing Prelude functions beyond the currently generated executable subset, continuing after `foldl` and tracking each newly claimed function in the matrix.
- Implemented functions use ordinary Haskell 2010 source/Core/STG/library semantics rather than backend-specific shortcuts where practical.
- Strictness, laziness, error behavior, and list-fusion-sensitive behavior are documented for every supported function.
- Native and conformance fixtures cover each newly claimed Prelude function.
- Remaining Prelude functions stay explicitly unclaimed or receive dedicated task IDs.

Required tests:
- library unit tests
- Core/STG preservation tests
- native wet tests
- Prelude conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/current-capabilities.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. The generated Prelude now claims and emits ordinary Core bindings
  for `($)`, `(.)`, `flip`, `head`, `tail`, `null`, `fst`, and `snd` in
  addition to the previously supported list functions. `($)`, `(.)`, and
  `flip` are lazy higher-order wrappers with no backend shortcut. `head`,
  `tail`, and `null` case-analyze ordinary lists; `head` and `tail` intentionally
  preserve partial-selector behavior by omitting the empty-list alternative so
  forced empty-list use becomes the same no-match runtime failure as other
  partial pattern matches. `fst` and `snd` case-analyze ordinary pair tuples and
  force only the tuple header plus the selected field. No list-fusion rewrites
  are introduced. Core, STG, LLVM/native, e2e, and conformance fixtures cover
  the successful function slice plus empty-list `head` native runtime failure.
  Remaining Prelude functions stay unclaimed and continue under PRELUDE-020,
  TEST-CONF-015, or later dedicated library tasks.

Acceptance criteria:
- Generated/importable standard-library module interfaces expand beyond `Prelude` to the modules required by the Haskell 2010 Report as implementation support lands.
- Module ownership stays explicit: no standard module is silently importable with an empty or fake surface.
- Import, export, child export, fixity, and instance behavior for standard modules follows the same `ModuleInterface` model as user modules.
- Docs and conformance fixtures identify every standard module as implemented, partially implemented, reserved, or unsupported-documented.
- The standard-library layout doc remains synchronized with the generated module interfaces.

Required tests:
- standard-library interface unit tests
- module conformance tests

Depends on:
- PRELUDE-019
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Complete the Haskell 2010 `Data.List` report API beyond the generated list/function slice.

Non-goals:
- Do not introduce fusion rewrites or optimizer-specific behavior as part of the library semantics.
- Do not weaken existing list laziness or partial-function boundaries.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Data.List` exports the Haskell 2010 list API beyond the current generated slice.
- List transformations, folds, scans, sublists, searches, indexing, zips, unzips, special-list helpers, and generic functions have real implementations or explicit narrower deviations.
- Partial functions and bottom behavior are documented and tested through native or runtime-error fixtures.

Required tests:
- `Data.List` conformance fixtures
- native wet tests
- runtime-error tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. `Data.List` is now a source-backed virtual standard-library module
  loaded through the module graph before generated-only builtin module handling.
  It exports the Haskell 2010 Report list API beyond the previous generated
  subset, including transformations, folds and scans, map accumulators,
  infinite-list producers, sublist operations, predicates, searches, indexing,
  zips and unzips, text helpers, set-like list operations, ordered-list helpers,
  `By` variants, and generic functions. The virtual module is parsed, renamed,
  typechecked, lowered through Core/STG, and compiled natively like ordinary
  source, while internal standard-library pattern diagnostics are suppressed so
  user diagnostics stay focused on user code. Native e2e and conformance
  fixtures cover the broad success surface, imported fixities, default and
  `--no-egglog` modes, emit-LLVM output, and empty-list partial selector
  runtime failure.

## LIB-003 — Data.Maybe report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- PRELUDE-DATA-003
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Complete the Haskell 2010 `Data.Maybe` module surface using the existing built-in `Maybe` constructors and dictionary machinery.

Non-goals:
- Do not change the representation of `Maybe`.
- Do not hide partial `fromJust` behavior behind total helpers.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Data.Maybe` exports `Maybe(..)`, `maybe`, `isJust`, `isNothing`, `fromJust`, `fromMaybe`, `maybeToList`, `listToMaybe`, `catMaybes`, and `mapMaybe` where required by the Haskell 2010 Libraries Report.
- Partial `fromJust` behavior has an explicit runtime-error fixture.
- Prelude and `Data.Maybe` imports share the same implemented definitions without ambiguity.

Required tests:
- `Data.Maybe` conformance fixtures
- native wet tests
- runtime-error tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. `Data.Maybe` is now a source-backed virtual standard-library
  module loaded through the module graph before generated-only builtin module
  handling. It re-exports the built-in `Maybe(..)` constructors and implements
  the Haskell 2010 Report helper surface: `maybe`, `isJust`, `isNothing`,
  `fromJust`, `fromMaybe`, `listToMaybe`, `maybeToList`, `catMaybes`, and
  `mapMaybe`. The virtual module is parsed, renamed, typechecked, lowered
  through Core/STG, and compiled natively like ordinary source. Native e2e and
  conformance fixtures cover the positive helper surface, default and
  `--no-egglog` modes, emit-LLVM output, and `fromJust Nothing` runtime
  failure.

## LIB-004 — Data.Char report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- PRELUDE-DATA-007
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Implement the Haskell 2010 `Data.Char` classification, conversion, digit, numeric representation, and string representation APIs.

Non-goals:
- Do not claim full Unicode behavior without explicit tests and documented character-table policy.
- Do not implement Show/Read escape behavior separately from TC-029 and TC-030.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Data.Char` exports report-compatible character classification, case conversion, digit, numeric representation, and string representation functions.
- Character ordinal behavior, escape rendering, and lexical read helpers agree with Show/Read tasks where they overlap.
- Reserved `Data.Char` imports are replaced by positive and negative fixtures once implemented.

Required tests:
- `Data.Char` conformance fixtures
- Show/Read character tests
- native wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. `Data.Char` is now a source-backed virtual standard-library
  module loaded through the module graph before generated-only builtin module
  handling. It re-exports `Char` and `String`, defines
  `GeneralCategory(..)`, and implements classification predicates, ASCII
  digit predicates, `ord`, `chr`, `digitToInt`, `intToDigit`, simple Unicode
  case conversion, `showLitChar`, `lexLitChar`, and `readLitChar` in ordinary
  source. The character table policy is explicit: the compact table covers the
  Haskell lexical ASCII surface, Latin-1, common Greek letter ranges, combining
  mark ranges, Unicode separator code points required by `isSpace`, and the
  Euro sign; unlisted code points classify as `NotAssigned` until a generated
  Unicode database table is introduced. Native e2e and conformance fixtures
  cover positive classification/conversion/literal behavior, default and
  `--no-egglog` modes, emit-LLVM output, and invalid `digitToInt` runtime
  failure.

## LIB-005 — Data.Array and Data.Ix report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- PRELUDE-020
- TC-031

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Implement `Data.Ix` and immutable non-strict `Data.Array` per the Haskell 2010 Libraries Report.

Non-goals:
- Do not implement mutable arrays or post-2010 array packages.
- Do not add boxed-array runtime behavior without clear forcing and bounds semantics.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/STG/LLVM.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Data.Ix` exports the `Ix` class and `range`/`index`/`inRange`/`rangeSize` behavior with derived `Ix` support where required.
- `Data.Array` exports immutable non-strict arrays, construction, access, updates, derived arrays, and report-specified errors.
- Array and Ix semantics are covered by native and negative conformance fixtures.

Required tests:
- `Data.Ix` conformance fixtures
- `Data.Array` native wet tests
- negative bounds/error tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. `Data.Ix` is importable and exports the Report `Ix` class with
  scalar instances for `Int`, `Char`, `Bool`, `Ordering`, and `()`, structural
  tuple instances, and derived `Ix` support for enumerations and single
  constructor product types. `Data.Array` is a source-backed virtual module
  implementing immutable non-strict arrays, `array`, `listArray`,
  `accumArray`, `(!)`, `bounds`, `indices`, `elems`, `assocs`, `(//)`,
  `accum`, `ixmap`, and `Functor`/`Eq`/`Ord`/`Show`/`Read` instances for
  supported element types. Positive native fixtures cover Ix ranges/indexing,
  derived Ix, array construction/access/update/accumulation/ixmap/fmap/
  comparison/show/read, and negative wet fixtures cover out-of-range and
  duplicate association runtime failures.

## LIB-006 — Data.Bits report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- TC-033
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Implement the Haskell 2010 `Data.Bits` class and operations for supported integral representations.

Non-goals:
- Do not silently generalize over numeric types without checked dictionary support.
- Do not rely on undefined target shift behavior.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/STG/LLVM.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Data.Bits` exports the Haskell 2010 `Bits(..)` class and all report methods through the generated standard-library interface.
- `Bits Int` is implemented with the required `Num` superclass, Core/STG interpreter behavior, and native LLVM lowering for bitwise operators, shifts, rotates, `bit`, setters/clearers/toggles, predicates, `bitSize`, and `isSigned`.
- Directional operations reject negative bit counts explicitly, and native lowering guards large shift counts so LLVM never receives undefined shift amounts.
- Fixed-width `Int*`/`Word*` instances are implemented by `LIB-009`; plain `Word` remains intentionally outside the Haskell 2010 basic FFI type set.

Required tests:
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/modules/data-bits.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/modules/data-bits-negative-shift-partial.hs`
- native wet tests through default, no-egglog, and emit-LLVM modes

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Created by TEST-CONF-015 so the reserved `Data.Bits` module has a numbered owner.
- Completed by implementing the report-shaped `Data.Bits` boundary for `Int`; `LIB-009` extends that same boundary to fixed-width `Int*`/`Word*` representations.

## LIB-007 — Data.Ratio and Rational report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- TC-033
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Replace the current executable-subset rational pair behavior with a report-shaped `Ratio`/`Rational` library surface.

Non-goals:
- Do not implement floating decimal parsing here.
- Do not change `Integral Int` behavior without preserving existing tests.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Data.Ratio` exports `Ratio`, `Rational`, `(%)`, `numerator`, `denominator`, and report-compatible normalization behavior.
- Prelude `Rational` and `toRational` use the same representation instead of the current executable-subset pair encoding.
- Zero denominator and sign normalization behavior are tested explicitly.

Required tests:
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/modules/data-ratio.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/modules/data-ratio-zero-denominator-partial.hs`
- native wet tests through default, no-egglog, emit-LLVM, and x86 clang paths

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Created by TEST-CONF-015 to make the Rational gap explicit.
- Complete for the current `Rational` surface. `Data.Ratio` is importable and
  exports `Ratio`, `Rational`, `(%)`, `numerator`, `denominator`, and
  `approxRational`. The executable runtime now represents `Rational` as
  normalized `Ratio Integer`, normalizes signs and common divisors, rejects
  zero denominators at runtime, and backs `toRational` with the same
  constructor instead of the old `(Int, Int)` pair. Built-in `Ratio Integer`
  dictionaries cover `Eq`, `Ord`, `Num`, `Real`, `Show`, and `Read`, including
  precedence-aware `show`/`read` round trips and list `Read`/`Show`.
  `approxRational` implements the Report simplest-rational algorithm for the
  currently supported `Rational` input type. Generic `Ratio a` dictionaries
  beyond the standard `Rational = Ratio Integer` path remain a broader
  typeclass/library generality task; floating/fractional integration is covered
  by `LIB-008`.

## LIB-008 — Data.Complex and floating numeric tower

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- FFI-010
- LIB-007
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Implement `Float`/`Double`, the floating Prelude classes, and the Haskell 2010 `Data.Complex` module.

Non-goals:
- Do not claim IEEE edge-case conformance before explicit platform tests exist.
- Do not implement only parser syntax without native semantics.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/STG/LLVM.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Float` and `Double` representations support `Fractional`, `Floating`, `RealFrac`, and `RealFloat` methods required by Prelude.
- `Data.Complex` exports `Complex` and rectangular, polar, magnitude, phase, conjugate, and numeric instances.
- Floating edge cases and native lowering are tested for supported targets.

Required tests:
- floating numeric conformance fixtures
- `Data.Complex` native wet tests
- backend/FFI marshalling tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Created by TEST-CONF-015 to tie the then-reserved `Data.Complex` module to the numeric tower work.
- Complete. `Float` and `Double` are represented through Core/STG/native
  literals and boxed runtime values, participate in defaulting, and provide
  executable `Eq`, `Ord`, `Num`, `Real`, `Fractional`, `Floating`,
  `RealFrac`, `RealFloat`, and `Show` dictionaries. Floating primitives cover
  arithmetic, comparisons, conversion from integer/rational input in the
  supported `Ratio Integer` representation, elementary and hyperbolic functions,
  power/atan2, integral conversions, and IEEE predicates used by the Prelude
  classes. `Data.Complex` is now an importable source-backed standard module
  exporting `Complex((:+))`, rectangular accessors, conjugation, polar
  construction/decomposition, magnitude, and phase, with generic
  `RealFloat a`-constrained `Eq`, `Num`, `Fractional`, `Floating`, `Show`,
  and `Read` instances. Native default/no-egglog fixtures cover the floating
  Prelude tower and `Data.Complex`; FFI floating ABI coverage remains under
  `FFI-010`. `LIB-010` now provides the importable `Numeric` module and native
  coverage for finite floating read/show helpers over the current executable
  `Double` path.

## LIB-009 — Data.Int and Data.Word report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- TC-033
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Move `Data.Word.Word` plus the fixed-width `Data.Int`/`Data.Word` support from importable type names to real representations, instances, and runtime behavior.

Non-goals:
- Do not conflate C ABI type aliases with Haskell fixed-width types unless the representation contract is explicit.
- Do not widen silently without checked conversions.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/STG/LLVM.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Data.Word.Word` and the fixed-width `Data.Int`/`Data.Word` types have real runtime representations, numeric instances, bounds, enum behavior, and conversions rather than only importable type names.
- Overflow, bounds, show/read, enum, bits, and FFI interactions are specified and tested.
- Generated module interfaces expose only implemented types and instances.

Required tests:
- fixed-width numeric conformance fixtures
- native wet tests
- FFI scalar tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete for the fixed-width `Data.Int`/`Data.Word` surface owned by this task. `Data.Int` and `Data.Word` now use shared fixed-width runtime representations for `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Word`, `Word8`, `Word16`, `Word32`, and `Word64`, with Core/STG/native primitives for modulo arithmetic, signed and unsigned comparisons, quotient/remainder, bounds, `Show`, `Read` through the arbitrary `Integer` lexer, `Enum`, `Ix`, and `Bits`. Native conformance covers overflow, bounds, unsigned `Word64` rendering, signed shift edge cases, fixed-width list/range behavior, and static FFI scalar marshalling for `Int8`, `Word8`, and `Word64`. Plain `Word` remains intentionally rejected as a Haskell 2010 basic FFI type; the Report basic FFI word types are `Word8`/`Word16`/`Word32`/`Word64`. `FFI-013` adds generated `Storable` support for the fixed-width and pointer-shaped runtime representations. Core/STG fixed-width conversions consume arbitrary `Integer` values and normalize modulo the target width; the native path remains bounded by the current i64 `Integer` payload representation.

## LIB-010 — Numeric report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- TC-029
- TC-030
- LIB-007
- LIB-008

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Implement the Haskell 2010 `Numeric` module and integrate it with report-shaped Show, Read, Ratio, and floating support.

Non-goals:
- Do not implement duplicate numeric parsers separate from TC-030 lexical read behavior.
- Do not claim formatting bases or floating rendering without golden tests.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Numeric` exports report-compatible showing, reading, and miscellaneous numeric formatting/parsing helpers.
- `showSigned`/`showInt`/`readSigned`/`readDec`/`showFloat`/`readFloat`/`lexDigits` integrate with Show and Read implementation choices.
- Positive and negative fixtures cover representative bases, signs, floats, and malformed inputs.

Required tests:
- `Numeric` conformance fixtures
- Show/Read integration tests
- native wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete for the current executable Haskell 2010 numeric tower. `Numeric` is now an importable source-backed virtual module with report-named exports for integral bases, signed reads/shows, finite floating renders/parses, `floatToDigits`, `lexDigits`, and `fromRat`. The implementation is covered through Core typechecking/evaluation, Core-to-STG preservation, LLVM emission, a native wet fixture, and the conformance manifest. Floating parser coverage targets the supported `Double` execution path and the current `Integer`/`Ratio Integer` representation; exact shortest-roundtrip floating lexical polish beyond the finite helper surface remains tracked separately from this module-level closure.

## LIB-011 — System.Environment and System.Exit report completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- IO-014
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Implement the Haskell 2010 process environment and exit modules with deterministic native behavior.

Non-goals:
- Do not introduce platform-specific process behavior without documented deviations.
- Do not mutate global environment state in tests without isolation.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/StandardLibrary.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/STG/LLVM.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `System.Environment` exports argument, program name, environment lookup, and environment mutation/query APIs where required by the Libraries Report.
- `System.Exit` exports `ExitCode` and process exit actions with deterministic native behavior.
- Command-line and environment-sensitive tests isolate process state and document platform limitations.

Required tests:
- `System.Environment` conformance fixtures
- `System.Exit` native wet tests
- CLI integration tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete as a generated native process module pair. `System.Environment` imports expose `getArgs`, `getProgName`, and `getEnv` backed by C `argc`/`argv`, basename extraction, environment lookup, `[Char]`/C-string conversion, and `DoesNotExistError` failures for missing variables. `System.Exit` imports expose `ExitCode(ExitSuccess, ExitFailure)`, `exitWith`, `exitFailure`, and `exitSuccess`; `ExitCode` has built-in `Eq`/`Ord`/`Show`/`Read`, valid native `exitWith` calls propagate a distinct non-catchable IO-exit result so `System.IO.Error.catch` does not intercept process termination, and POSIX-prohibited `ExitFailure 0` surfaces as a catchable illegal-operation `IOError`. Covered by `modules.system-environment`, `modules.system-exit`, `modules.system-exit-failure`, `modules.system-exit-catch`, and `modules.system-exit-zero-catch` conformance fixtures.

## LIB-012 — System.IO report completion

Status:

- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Expand `System.IO` from line-oriented stdin/stdout to the Haskell 2010 handle, file, buffering, seek, text IO, and error surfaces.

Non-goals:
- Do not implement asynchronous or post-2010 IO APIs.
- Do not claim post-2010 encoding, binary IO, threaded IO, or richer terminal
  control behavior from this Haskell 2010 text-IO task.

Files likely touched:

- `src/Haskell2010/Typecheck.hs`
- `src/Haskell2010/STG/LLVM.hs`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `System.IO` expands from the line-oriented stdin/stdout subset to the report handle, file open/close, buffering, seek, text input/output, and error behavior surface at the import/typechecking/Core/STG boundary.
- `System.IO.Error` integration is coordinated with IO-011 and tested through recoverable and unrecoverable IO cases.
- Native tests cover standard handles, file-backed handles, seek/position behavior,
  semi-closed `hGetContents`, productive `fixIO`, and report-shaped text IO
  behavior deterministically.

Required tests:
- `System.IO` conformance fixtures
- `System.IO.Error` conformance fixtures
- native wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Created by TEST-CONF-015 to make the remaining IO library surface explicit.
- Completed for the native Haskell 2010 text IO runtime model. The generated `System.IO`
  interface now exposes the Haskell 2010 Report names for `IOMode`,
  `BufferMode`, `SeekMode`, `Handle`, `HandlePosn`, standard handles,
  open/close, buffering, positioning, handle properties, text IO, Prelude IO
  aliases, `readIO`, and `readLn`. Core/STG/native primitives and validators
  cover the expanded surface, and native conformance covers standard handles,
  file-backed handles, open/close, `readFile`, `writeFile`, `appendFile`,
  buffering metadata, line and character input, `hLookAhead`, `getContents`,
  semi-closed `hGetContents`, EOF checks, `hFileSize`, `hSetFileSize`,
  `hGetPosn`, `hSetPosn`, `hSeek`, `hTell`, handle predicates, `hPrint`,
  `hShow`, and productive `fixIO` in default and no-egglog modes.

## IO-001 — IO type representation

## IO-006 — getLine

Status:

Category:

Depends on:
- RTS-017
- PRELUDE-DATA-007

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver getLine for IO and do-notation while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. `getLine` is available as a generated Prelude IO action returning ordinary `String = [Char]` values, native executables read from stdin line-by-line and strip line terminators, and IO-typed STG thunks are single-entry so repeated sequencing of the same IO action re-executes the effect instead of sharing a cached result.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

Acceptance criteria:
- getLine is implemented for the supported native IO subset, including repeated line reads, do-bind use, append/length composition over returned strings, Core/STG empty-stdin oracle coverage, conformance coverage, and default/no-egglog wet tests with stdin.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:

- native wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/current-capabilities.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M13 (IO and do-notation). Complete for current line-input subset: `getLine :: IO String` lowers through Core/STG/native, native runtime input builds list-backed strings, and stdin fixtures cover two sequential reads. Recoverable `IOError` behavior is implemented by IO-011; EOF-specific native standard-handle behavior is covered by LIB-012.

## IO-007 — return

Scope:
- Deliver `(>>=)` for the supported stdout-oriented IO subset while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Core and STG IO actions now carry both accumulated stdout chunks and a result value, explicit `(>>=)` enters the continuation with that result, and do-notation `<-` statements lower through the same bind path.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.

Acceptance criteria:
- `(>>=)` typechecks, lowers, evaluates, and compiles natively for supported `IO` actions.
- Do-notation `<-` bind statements typecheck, lower, evaluate, and compile natively for normal stdout examples.
- Core and STG evaluator IO values preserve the returned action result while accumulating stdout output.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:

Notes:
- Milestone M13 (IO and do-notation). Completed for explicit `(>>=)`, do-bind statements, `return`-produced values, normal `putStrLn`/`print` examples over `String`, `Char`, and lists, native `getLine` over stdin, recoverable `IOError` behavior, and the supported `Monad IO` dictionary. The expanded `System.IO` surface is tracked by LIB-012, including file-backed handles, seek/position behavior, semi-closed lazy contents, and productive `fixIO`.

Acceptance criteria:
- Core, STG, and native IO actions represent success and failure explicitly so `ioError`, `catch`, `try`, and `fail` compose instead of aborting before handlers run.
- `System.IO.Error` exposes `IOError`, `IOErrorType` constants, `mkIOError`, `annotateIOError`, classifiers, accessors, `userError`, `ioError`, `catch`, and `try` for the supported executable subset.
- Uncaught native IO failures terminate nonzero, while caught failures preserve `IOError` payloads through `catch` and `try`.

Acceptance criteria:
- Source module interfaces retain declared instances and every transitively
  imported instance regardless of the module's export list.
- Empty import lists, ordinary import lists, `hiding`, and qualified imports
  filter names only; they do not filter instances.
- Whole-program Haskell 2010 typechecking sees exactly the instances reachable
  through the loaded import graph, so imported source-instance dictionaries are
  emitted only when an import chain reaches the declaring module.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.

  negative conformance coverage. User-written instance contexts and
  package-scale instance discovery remain separate later work.

  synthetic built-in `import Prelude` only when no explicit `Prelude` import
  declaration exists.
- Explicit `Prelude` imports, including `qualified`, `()`, and `hiding`, suppress
  the implicit import and participate in ordinary cumulative import semantics.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.

Acceptance criteria:
- `ccall` and `stdcall` are represented structurally in parsed and renamed foreign declarations.
- The FFI typechecker accepts Haskell 2010 `ccall`/`stdcall` declarations and rejects non-Haskell-2010 calling conventions before lowering.
- The supported ccall ABI slice links to native runtime lowering; stdcall remains represented and typechecked but target-specific native lowering remains an explicit gap.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:

Notes:
- Milestone M15 (FFI). Complete. ccall/stdcall and reserved calling-convention identifiers are represented structurally, unsupported conventions are rejected before native lowering, Report-shaped ccall entity strings with unbracketed .h headers/defaulted symbols are parsed, and the supported ccall native ABI slice is implemented; target-specific non-ccall native ABI lowering remains an explicit future boundary rather than an open representation gap.

- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

- `src/Haskell2010/Native.hs`
- `src/Backend/LLVM/Toolchain.hs`
- `docs/runtime-spec.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Static, `dynamic`, and `wrapper` foreign imports lower to explicit Core/STG foreign-call nodes, and `foreign export` declarations lower to explicit Core/STG module metadata.
- Address imports lower to explicit inert Core/STG foreign-import value nodes.
- Core/STG validators, pretty-printers, evaluators, optimizer traversal, and native backend boundaries preserve the foreign IR without silently dropping imports.
- Core/STG evaluation reports explicit unsupported runtime diagnostics when foreign calls are reached outside native lowering.
- Supported `foreign import ccall` nodes lower to native LLVM declarations/direct calls or indirect `FunPtr` calls with scalar integer/Bool/Char/Float/Double marshalling, `Ptr`/`FunPtr` pointer marshalling, static `&symbol` address boxing, `wrapper` callback trampolines, and `IO` sequencing.
- Explicit `StablePtr` ownership, manual `ForeignPtr` finalizer APIs, `freeHaskellFunPtr`, wrapper callback-slot reclamation, callback-after-free rejection, and reverse-order/idempotent finalization are implemented and wet-tested; automatic GC finalizer scheduling remains scoped out under the process-lifetime runtime model.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:

Core/STG IR is complete for imports and export metadata, scalar/floating/pointer/static-address/dynamic/wrapper/export ccall native runtime integration is implemented and wet-tested, explicit StablePtr/manual ForeignPtr/freeHaskellFunPtr ownership paths are wired through the runtime, and unsupported FFI entities still fail at explicit boundaries.

## FFI-007 — LLVM external declaration lowering

Status:
- complete

Category:
- runtime

Depends on:
- LLVM-002

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver LLVM external declaration lowering for Haskell 2010 FFI while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Keep the work behind the IR/API boundary named by this category and update conformance status rather than claiming broader support.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

- `src/Backend/LLVM/Toolchain.hs`
- `docs/runtime-spec.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Supported static `foreign import ccall` symbols emit LLVM external declarations with ABI-accurate argument and result types.
- Static scalar and pointer calls emit direct LLVM `call` instructions and link successfully against C helper objects in native wet tests.
- Static `&symbol` imports for `Ptr a` and `FunPtr ft` emit external data/function declarations and box the raw address as a pointer value.
- `dynamic` imports emit typed indirect calls through unboxed `FunPtr` values.
- `wrapper` imports emit reclaimable process-lifetime callback slots and C-callable trampoline functions for the supported scalar/floating/pointer ABI slice.
- Unsupported FFI entities still report explicit native ABI diagnostics instead of being silently dropped.
- Automatic GC finalization remains scoped out under the process-lifetime runtime model; explicit wrapper callback release is implemented through `freeHaskellFunPtr`.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:

Static scalar/floating/pointer ccall declarations/direct calls, address imports, dynamic imports, wrapper callbacks with `freeHaskellFunPtr` reclamation, foreign export ccall entrypoints, and FFI link metadata are implemented with explicit native ABI diagnostics for unsupported entities.

## FFI-008 — FFI native tests

Status:
- complete

Category:
- runtime

Depends on:
- LLVM-002

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver FFI native tests for Haskell 2010 FFI while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Keep the work behind the IR/API boundary named by this category and update conformance status rather than claiming broader support.

- `src/Haskell2010/Native.hs`
- `src/Backend/LLVM/Toolchain.hs`
- `docs/runtime-spec.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Static scalar and floating `ccall` native tests compile/link generated LLVM with a C helper and assert stdout.
- Static pointer/address native tests cover `Ptr`, `FunPtr`, data `&symbol`, function `&symbol`, pointer arguments, pointer results, and ordered pointer mutation through `IO`.
- Dynamic/wrapper native tests cover indirect `FunPtr` calls, multiple live wrapped callbacks, C-to-Haskell callback re-entry, callback `IO`, result marshalling, explicit wrapper release, double-free/idempotence, slot reclamation, and callback-after-free runtime failure.
- Foreign export native tests cover C helpers calling exported pure and `IO` Haskell functions; remaining FFI forms add native tests as each ABI feature lands.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

## FFI-009 — FFI-wide deferral retired

Status:
- complete

Category:
- runtime

Depends on:
- LLVM-002

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- The project no longer treats Haskell 2010 FFI as a whole-feature documented deviation.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:

- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- The project no longer treats Haskell 2010 FFI as a whole-feature documented deviation.
- Implemented FFI support is tracked by FFI-001 through FFI-008, and remaining gaps are tracked by dedicated follow-up tasks instead of one broad deferral bucket.
- Unsupported FFI behavior remains explicit in the conformance matrix and docs until each follow-up task is implemented.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-ffi-design.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Added or refreshed by the tracker reconciliation audit so future work has a stable task ID instead of living only in roadmap prose.

## FFI-010 — floating-point FFI marshalling

Status:
- complete

Category:
- runtime

Depends on:
- FFI-005
- FFI-007

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Foreign imports and exports validate and marshal `Float`, `Double`, `CFloat`, and `CDouble` according to the supported C ABI.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Foreign imports and exports validate and marshal `Float`, `Double`, `CFloat`, and `CDouble` according to the supported C ABI.
- Core/STG/LLVM types distinguish floating-point ABI values from boxed runtime values without corrupting existing integer/pointer marshalling.
- Native C-helper fixtures cover direct calls, callbacks, exports, and result marshalling for floating-point values.
- Unsupported foreign ABI combinations continue to fail explicitly until implemented.
- Docs and matrix remove floating-point FFI from the remaining-gap list only after native coverage passes.

Required tests:
- typechecker tests
- Core/STG validation tests
- LLVM lowering tests
- native C-helper wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-ffi-design.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. Native floating FFI marshalling maps `Float`/`CFloat` to LLVM `float` and `Double`/`CDouble` to LLVM `double`, boxes runtime `Float`/`Double` values separately from integer/pointer objects, and covers static calls, dynamic `FunPtr` calls, wrapper callbacks, and `foreign export` through `ffi.floating-ccall` in default and no-egglog modes.

## FFI-011 — FFI link metadata

Status:
- complete

Category:
- runtime

Depends on:
- FFI-002
- FFI-007
- LLVM-016

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Foreign import entity metadata preserves header/library/object requirements needed for portable C linking.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- Foreign import entity metadata preserves header/library/object requirements needed for portable C linking.
- The CLI/native toolchain accepts and propagates required extra objects or libraries without hardcoding test-only paths.
- Conformance and e2e fixtures cover header-qualified entities and explicit link inputs.
- Missing link dependencies report stable diagnostics.
- Docs describe the supported link model and remaining platform-specific limitations.

Required tests:
- parser tests
- toolchain tests
- native C-helper wet tests
- negative link diagnostics

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-ffi-design.md`
- `docs/llvm-backend-spec.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. Foreign import/export lowering now carries `ForeignLinkMetadata` through the Haskell 2010 native result and emits LLVM comments for header-qualified imports, static/address symbols, and exported C symbols. The CLI and LLVM toolchain accept repeated `--link-object`, `--link-library`, `--library-path`, and `--framework` flags and pass them to clang. The conformance harness now builds FFI helper fixtures through those link flags instead of a side-channel manual clang path, and tests cover header-qualified ccall metadata plus missing link-input diagnostics.

## FFI-012 — callback and finalizer lifetime completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- runtime

Depends on:
- FFI-006
- FFI-007
- FFI-008

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- `freeHaskellFunPtr` and callback-slot reclamation are implemented with documented ownership and re-entry behavior.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Haskell2010/`
- `test/haskell2010/conformance/`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Acceptance criteria:
- `freeHaskellFunPtr` and callback-slot reclamation are implemented with documented ownership and re-entry behavior.
- Automatic `ForeignPtr` finalizer scheduling is implemented or explicitly scoped against the project runtime ownership model.
- Callback and finalizer lifetimes are safe across nested C-to-Haskell re-entry and explicit `StablePtr` usage.
- Native wet tests cover reclamation, double-free/idempotence, callback-after-free rejection, and finalizer ordering.
- Docs distinguish manual process-lifetime behavior from any automatic lifetime guarantees.

Required tests:
- runtime unit tests
- native callback wet tests
- finalizer wet tests
- runtime-error conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-ffi-design.md`
- `docs/runtime-spec.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete. `freeHaskellFunPtr` is now a generated `Foreign`/`Foreign.Ptr` binding that lowers through Core, STG, validation, evaluation, optimization boundaries, and native LLVM. Wrapper imports now allocate from reclaimable per-import callback slots, double-free of a wrapper pointer is idempotent, unknown frees and callback-after-free paths abort instead of re-entering stale closures, and freed slots can be reused after the fixed pool is saturated. Manual `ForeignPtr` finalization remains explicit under the process-lifetime allocation model: automatic GC scheduling is not claimed, while `finalizeForeignPtr` is idempotent and finalizers run in reverse registration order. Unit/native and conformance fixtures cover wrapper reclamation, callback-after-free runtime failure, double-free/idempotence, finalizer ordering, StablePtr round trips, and withForeignPtr/touchForeignPtr liveness barriers.

## FFI-013 — Foreign library surface completion

Status:
- complete

Category:
- libraries

Depends on:
- FFI-005
- PRELUDE-020

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- The `Foreign`, `Foreign.C`, `Foreign.C.Types`, `Foreign.Ptr`, `Foreign.StablePtr`, `Foreign.ForeignPtr`, `Foreign.Marshal.*`, and `Foreign.Storable` surfaces are tracked module-by-module against the Haskell 2010 libraries.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.

Acceptance criteria:
- The `Foreign`, `Foreign.C`, `Foreign.C.Types`, `Foreign.Ptr`, `Foreign.StablePtr`, `Foreign.ForeignPtr`, `Foreign.Marshal.*`, and `Foreign.Storable` surfaces are tracked module-by-module against the Haskell 2010 libraries.
- Implemented functions and types use generated module interfaces, ordinary import/export rules, and conformance fixtures.
- Unsupported functions remain explicit unsupported-documented cases rather than implicit omissions.
- Docs identify the exact implemented, partial, and pending Foreign module surfaces.
- Library coverage is reflected in the standard-library layout and conformance matrix.

Required tests:
- standard-library interface tests
- typechecker tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-standard-library-layout.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-ffi-design.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Complete for the current generated/importable Foreign library surface. `Foreign.Ptr` exposes null pointer values and pointer/function-pointer casts; `Foreign.ForeignPtr` exposes `FinalizerPtr`, `FinalizerEnvPtr`, `unsafeForeignPtrToPtr`, and `castForeignPtr`; `Foreign.Marshal.Error` and `Foreign.Marshal.Utils` expose guard and Maybe pointer helpers; `Foreign.C.Error` exposes `Errno(Errno)`, all Report errno constants with target-runtime values, `isValidErrno`, errno access/reset, `errnoToIOError`, retry/may-block guards, and path-carrying errno helpers; `Foreign.Storable` exposes generated dictionaries for supported scalar, pointer, and fixed-width runtime representations; `Foreign.Marshal.Alloc` and `Foreign.Marshal.Array` expose raw allocation, reallocation, free, byte copy/move, pointer advancement, and list/sentinel array helpers; and `Foreign.C.String` exposes C/CW string conversion helpers. Native conformance fixtures `ffi.foreign-library-surface`, `ffi.foreign-storable`, `ffi.foreign-marshal-array`, `ffi.foreign-c-string`, and `ffi.foreign-c-error` cover the surface in default and no-egglog modes.

Core and STG interpreter closures now carry source-defined top-level binding spans so forced runtime failures are reported at the responsible source binding.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

## DIAG-014 — nested runtime spans

Status:

Scope:
- Deliver nested runtime spans for Diagnostics while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Source expression spans now survive typed elaboration, Core, Core optimization, STG lowering, lazy STG thunk allocation, and partial-application thunks so Core/STG interpreter failures report the innermost surviving source expression.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

- Core-to-STG nested runtime attribution unit tests
- negative conformance tests

Documentation updates:
- `docs/diagnostics-spec.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M17 (Diagnostics). Completed by adding source span wrappers to typed/Core/STG expressions, preserving them through substitution, validation, optimization, STG lowering, evaluator execution, and test-side structural walkers. Core and STG nested runtime attribution now point at source expressions such as `div` in `main = 10 + div 1 0` rather than only the containing binding or outer arithmetic expression.

Scope:
- Deliver `hegglog compile` for CLI productization while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Keep the work behind the IR/API boundary named by this category and update conformance status rather than claiming broader support.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Main.hs`
- `src/CLI/Compile.hs`
- `src/CLI/Report.hs`
- `test/Main.hs`
- `test/e2e/Main.hs`

Acceptance criteria:
- `hegglog compile` is implemented, completed, or explicitly documented according to status `complete`.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- CLI unit tests
- help text tests
- CLI wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `README.md`
- `docs/current-capabilities.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Implementation notes:
- The default native build path remains direct and temporary.
- The kept native build path is intentionally two-stage: `.ll` to `.o`, then `.o` plus explicit link options to the executable. This makes the preserved object file match the actual linked artifact.
- Kept artifact paths are deterministic and currently keyed by source basename.

Validation:
- `cabal build hegglog`
- CLI parser/help tests cover accepted and rejected `--keep-intermediates` forms.
- CLI wet tests cover preserved LLVM, object, and executable artifacts and stdout/stderr preservation.

Notes:
- Milestone M18 (CLI productization). Status reflects the codebase after commit 0043a2d and should be revised whenever implementation or conformance coverage changes.

## CLI-005 — `hegglog report`

Status:
- complete

Category:
- cli

Depends on:
- DIAG-015

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver `hegglog report` for CLI productization while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. Keep the work behind the IR/API boundary named by this category and update conformance status rather than claiming broader support.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

Files likely touched:
- `src/Main.hs`
- `src/CLI/Compile.hs`
- `src/CLI/Report.hs`
- `test/Main.hs`
- `test/e2e/Main.hs`

Acceptance criteria:
- `hegglog report` emits source-aware diagnostic/status reports for legacy `.hg` and Haskell 2010 `.hs` sources.
- Report mode supports `--no-egglog`, `--strict-egglog`, and repeated `-i`/`--import-path` flags with scoped command diagnostics.
- Haskell 2010 reports parse, rename, typecheck, optimize according to flags, validate Core/STG, and render stable warnings, optimization, typed Core, and STG sections.
- Legacy `.hg` reports preserve parser/typechecker/interpreter/ANF/facts/rewrite/EGraph/Egglog/Core output and make strict Egglog fallback failures explicit.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- CLI unit tests
- help text tests
- CLI wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `README.md`
- `docs/current-capabilities.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Notes:
- Milestone M18 (CLI productization). Status reflects the codebase after CLI-005 implementation and should be revised whenever implementation or conformance coverage changes.

Implementation notes:
- `CLI.Command` parses `report FILE [--no-egglog] [--strict-egglog] [-i PATH]`; the legacy positional `hegglog FILE` form remains mapped to report mode with default options.
- `.hs` reports use the same Haskell 2010 module-graph/check pipeline as `check`, including import search paths, Core Egglog mode selection, Core/STG validation, and warning rendering.
- `.hg` reports preserve the existing full legacy report and now represent disabled Egglog and strict Egglog fallback failures explicitly instead of hiding optimizer status.

Validation:
- `cabal build hegglog`
- CLI parser/help tests cover report options and scoped rejection of output, dump, native link, and conflicting Egglog flags.
- CLI wet tests cover Haskell 2010 report sections, `--no-egglog`, legacy report compatibility, and strict legacy optimizer rejection.

## CLI-006 — `hegglog emit-core`

Status:

Category:
- cli

Depends on:

Scope:
- Deliver `hegglog emit-core` for CLI productization while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. The command now emits validated typed Haskell 2010 Core to stdout or a file, supports original/optimized/both Core selections, honors `--no-egglog` and import paths for `.hs`, and exposes legacy `.hg` Core IR only through the legacy default path.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.

Depends on:
- DIAG-015

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver `hegglog emit-stg` for CLI productization while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. The command now emits validated Haskell 2010 STG to stdout or a file, honors `--no-egglog` and import paths for `.hs`, uses a stable STG pretty-printer for runtime/backend debugging, and rejects legacy `.hg` sources because that frontend has no STG layer.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

## CLI-010 — `--strict-egglog`

Status:
- complete

Category:
- cli

Depends on:
- DIAG-015

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver `--strict-egglog` for CLI productization while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. `hegglog check`, `hegglog compile`, `hegglog emit-core`, `hegglog emit-stg`, and `hegglog run` accept the flag. Default optimization remains opportunistic, `--no-egglog` disables Egglog, and `--strict-egglog` requires Egglog support instead of silently falling back to unoptimized ANF/Core for nontrivial unsupported optimizer input.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.

- `src/Main.hs`
- `src/CLI/Compile.hs`
- `src/CLI/Command.hs`

Acceptance criteria:
- `--strict-egglog` is accepted by check, compile, emit-core, emit-stg, and run.
- `--strict-egglog` is rejected when combined with `--no-egglog`.
- Strict mode requires Egglog support and fails instead of falling back to unoptimized ANF/Core when nontrivial optimizer input is unsupported.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Required tests:
- CLI unit tests
- help text tests
- CLI wet tests

Documentation updates:
- `README.md`
- `docs/current-capabilities.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-todo.md`

Implementation notes:
- Legacy `.hg` strict mode fails on top-level/lambda-lifted/closure-converted programs that previously reported Egglog unsupported and compiled unoptimized.
- Haskell 2010 strict mode routes through the Core Egglog optimizer in strict mode; unsupported nontrivial Core fragments become check/compile errors.
- The option parser rejects `--strict-egglog` with `--no-egglog` before pipeline execution.

Validation:
- `cabal test hegglog-test`
- `cabal test e2e-wet-test`
- Manual strict CLI smoke tests for supported legacy optimization, legacy fallback rejection, Haskell Core fallback rejection, and flag conflict diagnostics.

Notes:
- Milestone M18 (CLI productization). Status reflects the codebase after commit 0043a2d and should be revised whenever implementation or conformance coverage changes.

## CLI-011 — `--keep-intermediates`

Status:
- complete

Category:
- cli

Depends on:
- DIAG-015

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver `--keep-intermediates` for CLI productization while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. `hegglog compile` and `hegglog run` accept the flag. LLVM-output modes preserve a generated LLVM copy under `.context/hegglog/intermediates`; native keep mode writes LLVM, compiles a real object file, then links the executable from that object. `hegglog run --keep-intermediates` also preserves the otherwise-temporary executable in the same directory. Non-codegen commands reject the flag with scoped diagnostics.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

Files likely touched:

- `src/Main.hs`
- `src/CLI/Compile.hs`
- `src/CLI/Command.hs`
- `test/Main.hs`

Acceptance criteria:
- `--keep-intermediates` is accepted by compile and run and rejected by non-codegen commands with scoped diagnostics.
- LLVM intermediates are preserved under `.context/hegglog/intermediates` for LLVM output modes.
- Native keep mode preserves generated LLVM, object, and temporary run executable artifacts under `.context/hegglog/intermediates`.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

## CLI-012 — dump flags

Status:
- complete

Category:
- cli

Depends on:
- DIAG-015

Blocks:
- none

Scope:
- Deliver stable dump flags for CLI productization while preserving the current .hg substrate and the documented Haskell 2010 executable-subset behavior. `hegglog check`, `hegglog compile`, and `hegglog run` accept `--dump-core`, `--dump-optimized-core`, and `--dump-stg`. Dumps render original typed Core, optimized typed Core, and validated STG with stable section headers on stderr, preserving LLVM stdout and program stdout contracts. Legacy `.hg` sources reject dump flags with a clear diagnostic because that pipeline has no typed Haskell 2010 Core/STG artifacts.

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.
- Do not change runtime semantics unless this task explicitly owns runtime behavior.
- Do not add optimizer rewrites outside documented safety rules.

- `src/CLI/Compile.hs`
- `src/CLI/Report.hs`
- `src/CLI/Command.hs`
- `test/Main.hs`
- `test/e2e/Main.hs`

Implementation notes:
- Dump artifacts are carried through the existing Haskell 2010 check/compile results rather than recomputing the pipeline.
- The selected sections are emitted in deterministic order: Core, Optimized Core, then STG.
- `emit-core` and `emit-stg` remain explicit IR output commands and reject dump flags instead of duplicating command semantics.

Validation:
- `cabal build hegglog`
- CLI parser/help tests cover dump flag parsing and invalid command combinations.
- CLI wet tests cover check stderr dumps, compile `--emit-llvm` stdout preservation, run stdout preservation, and legacy `.hg` rejection.

Acceptance criteria:
- `--dump-core`, `--dump-optimized-core`, and `--dump-stg` are accepted by `check`, `compile`, and `run`.
- Dump output uses stable section headers on stderr so LLVM stdout and program stdout remain machine-readable.
- Dump flags reject legacy `.hg` sources with a clear diagnostic because that pipeline has no typed Haskell 2010 Core/STG artifacts.
- All affected compiler invariants remain validated by the relevant unit, conformance, and wet tests.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to this task for implemented work or explicit remaining gaps.

Acceptance criteria:
- Negative fixtures cover malformed `where` groups, invalid pattern bindings, invalid record updates, unsupported expression forms, duplicate source binders, and impossible or redundant match surfaces.
- Each negative fixture asserts a stable diagnostic category and fails if the compiler silently accepts the program.
- Unsupported source forms use `unsupported-documented` only when the limitation is explicit in the matrix and tracker.
- All new fixtures are listed in `test/haskell2010/conformance/manifest.json` and validated by the conformance script.
- The Haskell 2010 conformance matrix points to these fixtures from the relevant source-surface rows.

Required tests:
- negative conformance tests
- manifest validation

  includes stable diagnostic-category fixtures for malformed `where` layout,
  misindented line-broken `where` keywords,
  duplicate binders in top-level pattern bindings and function equations,
  constructor-operator misuse in value binding syntax,
  invalid record updates, an impossible `case` pattern/scrutinee combination,
  and a documented unsupported constrained expression signature.

## TEST-CONF-014 — source matrix closure

Non-goals:
- Do not weaken existing .hg behavior or tests.
- Do not claim full Haskell 2010 or GHC compatibility from this task alone.
- Do not make unrelated architecture or formatting churn.

Acceptance criteria:
- Every expression, declaration, and pattern row in the conformance matrix is backed by an implemented fixture, a compile-error fixture, or an unsupported-documented fixture.
- Rows that are only parser/renamer-supported remain labelled as such and link to the next implementation task rather than being counted as executable support.
- The matrix, manifest, roadmap, status summary, and tracker agree on source-surface status.
- The conformance validator catches missing manifest-to-matrix coverage for source-surface fixtures.
- No broad source-surface work remains only in prose without a task ID.

Required tests:
- conformance validator
- matrix review
- manifest review

Documentation updates:
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-matrix.md`
- `docs/haskell2010-conformance-results.md`

Notes:
- Complete. Added a machine-checked Source Surface Matrix Closure table to
  the conformance matrix covering all declaration, expression, and pattern
  rows. The conformance validator now rejects missing closure rows, fixture
  paths not present in the manifest, and `declarations`/`expressions`/`patterns`
  manifest fixtures omitted from the closure table. It also requires the
  source-surface negative and unsupported fixtures to remain linked from the
  closure table. The SURFACE source-surface implementation gap tasks are now
  complete and backed by manifest fixtures.

- Chapter 9 Prelude and the Part II Haskell 2010 Libraries module inventory are reconciled against the tracker before additional library surface is claimed.
- Unsupported library features remain explicit unsupported-documented cases until implemented.
- The closure audit explicitly accounts for report-shaped Show/Read, remaining Prelude classes/functions, Control.Monad, Data.Array, Data.Bits, Data.Char, Data.Complex, Data.Int, Data.Ix, Data.List, Data.Maybe, Data.Ratio, Data.Word, Numeric, System.Environment, System.Exit, System.IO, System.IO.Error, and the FFI-owned Foreign.* modules.
- The conformance results summary reports library coverage by class/function/module instead of only by broad category.
- Docs, tracker, matrix, and manifest agree on library support boundaries.
- The validator catches manifest cases that are missing from the matrix or docs coverage summary.

Required tests:
- conformance suite

Added a validator-backed Library Conformance Closure table, explicit unsupported-documented fixtures for reserved Report modules, a positive scalar type import fixture for `Data.Int`/`Data.Word`/`Foreign.C.Types`, and numbered `LIB-*` follow-up tasks for every previously unnumbered library gap. Further library implementation must update the table, matrix, manifest, and generated module boundary together.
